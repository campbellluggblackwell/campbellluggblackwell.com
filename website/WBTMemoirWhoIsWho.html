                      as she was called was born near Plattsburgh, but her
                      parents were French-Canadian immigrants. Dad thought his

                      for his ancestors. (However it may be true for some of his
                      Boulė cousins.) Melinda had 11 children and also raised 3
                      grandchildren: Maurice, dad &amp; Harmon, but drew the

                      Rochester, NY where he taught typing in HS. As a kid, that
                      seemed like a strange career for a man. He married Gisela
                      Voght, whom my paents always addressed and referred to as
                      "Marcella." They had one child, a daughter named Melinda

                    <p><a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bulley-468">Uncle
                        Harry</a> was one of the most memorable relatives I met.
                      He was a real character. At times he was very talkative,
                      and sometimes very uncommunicative, depending on his mood.
                      When I knew him, he lived at his parental home with
                      sisters Della and Anne. Della told us that once he hadn't
                      spoken a word to her or Anne for three months. He wasn't
                      mad; just didn't feel like talking. At dinner he would
                      point if he wanted something passed. The things I remember
                      best about Great Uncle Harry, were his stories, birds, and
                      headlights.</p>
                    <p>He had some fascinating stories about people he met
                      chauffeuring silent movies around Plattsburgh. He operated
                      a "livery service," that eras's equivalentr of a limo
                      service. Silent movies were being made around Plattsburg
                      because Lake Champlain could serve as the ocean, the sand
                      beaches as desert, and the mountains and Ausable Chasm
                      provided the rest. He met Pearl White when she was filming
                      the Perils of Pauline films there. Also the Marx brothers.
                      My mother said he got invited to a number of events
                      because the film people saw him as a quaint character,
                      which he was. I especially remember his pidgeons, his
                      pellet gun and his expertise with headligts. He raised
                      pigeons, which was interesting to me as a kid. He once got
                      a blue ribbon at a pigeon race in St. Louis. He was also
                      an avid gardener, who shot song birds that tried to eat
                      his berries or whatever. He had a pellet gun that could be
                      pumped up to be powerful. He would sit in an upstairs
                      window and shoot birds when they invaded his garden. That
                      horrified me. The headlights part fascinated me the most.
                      He and I would sit on his front porch steps at night and
                      as cars drew in sight he would call the year and make by
                      just their headlights. When the car would pass the house
                      and become visle under a street light, he was right. He
                      taught me how, but I was never as good as he was. It was
                      all based on how high the headlights were from the ground
                      and how close together they were. There weren't the
                      additional lights or different shapes to lights then. </p>
                    <p>He inherited his father's part-time job as tender of the
                      harbor lights on the breakwater. Like his pegleged father,
                      when the harbor was open in the warmer months, morning and
                      evening, he would row out to the breakwater, climb the
                      lader to the harbor warning lights at each end of the
                      breakwater, and light (or extinguish the lamps. He had
                      both legs, but one leg had a stiff knee, so that made
                      climbing the lader (or shifting his limo/taxi's gears) a
                      challenge. </p>

                      River, which drains Lake Champlain, empties into the St.
                      Lawrence, near Montreal), and Catherine Melinda LaPlante.
                      I don't know when he emmigrated to the US because we had
                      open borders back then. You just walked (or rode) across
                      the border and that was it. But by the time the Civil War
                      started he was in Plattsburgh, NY and enlisted into the NY
                      16th infantry. <fig><img src="UniformNY16th.jpg" alt="Photo of uniform of NY 16th Infantry, Civil War"

                    <p></p>
                    According to oral tradition, the Sgt. that mustered him in,
                    changed his name to Mitchell Bulley. Mitch was in several
                    battles, was wounded in three, and was a POW twice, in Libby
                    Prison and Belle Isle.
                    <p></p>
                    <p> His 3rd wound never healed properely and after being
                      mustered out, they removed a leg. Returning after 2 years,
                      he married Melinda and had 11 kids. After the war he
                      farmed, and because of his wounds was given a job as a
                      pension -- tending to the lights on the Plattsburgh harbor
                      breakwater. During the season when the harbor was open, he
                      would row out to the breakwater each morning and evening,
                      climb a tower to the light and light or extinguish it.
                      Then row to the other end of the breakwater and repeat the
                      process. French was spoken in his home, and although he
                      was stern, Dad and Maurice loved him. </p>

                    <p>Even though he was dad's uncle, he was only 10 years
                      older than dad. I never met my <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bulley-28">Great-uncle
                        Kearney</a> (pronounded "Carney"), altho I met and
                      became friends with his youngest son, Rod. I don't know
                      what dad's gripe with Kearney was about. Our questions
                      were always met with "I don't want to talk about it." All
                      we were told was "Don't be a bum like Kearney." Or
                      occasionally "Kearney's a crumb." My mother had no idea
                      what that was all about. She met Kearney once. She and dad
                      were walking down a street in Plattsburgh and encountered
                      him by chance. Dad introduced them and they chatted for a
                      few minutes. She found Kearny to be friendly and charming.
                      Rod had no idea what the problem was. I should have asked
                      Aunt Della, Uncle Harry, or Cousin Harm, but never thought
                      to do so. Kearney had four children, all born 7 years
                      apart. Kearney was a brakeman for the Delaware &amp;
                      Hudson RR, fell and was was run over, losing a leg in the
                      process. His first wife, Mary Lombard died giving birth to

                        grandmother Thompson</a> seems unlucky in love. She
                      moved from Plattsburgh to Williamsport, PA to stay with
                      her sister, Mary Jane BULLY LaBelle, to study nursing.
                      After getting "capped" by the Williamsport Hospital's
                      School of Nursing, she fell in love with a handsome TB
                      patient, Walter Thompson, a violinist from England. I was
                      told he came to the Adirondaks to be cured by the mountain
                      air, but a news clip refers to her as "formerly of New
                      York City" so they may have met there. Apparently he went
                      into remission long enough to marry and have two children,
                      Maurice and dad, but died when dad was 13 months old. At
                      that point, Lulu left her sons to be raised by her mother
                      and returned to Williamsport to work as a nurse there. 13
                      years after her husmand's death, she married a doctor she
                      met in Williamsport, Dr. Geo. C. Burnley. Lulu and Doc
                      Burnley moved to Nelson, PA and she retrieved her sons
                      from Plattsburgh -- which they didn't want to leave.
                      According to my parents, Doc Burnley was an abusinve
                      alcoholic, who beat his wife and step-sons when drunk. Dad
                      said he and Maurice practiced boxing in order to defend
                      themselves, and one time when Burnley attacked them they
                      managaed to beat him up and ran away from home. I estimate
                      that was abt. 1907. Perhaps Lulu left him, because her
                      1906 obit has her living then in Tioga, PA. Mom said the
                      Nelson folks "ran him (Dr. Burnley) out of town." 1n the
                      1910 census he's shown as a widower living in Osceola, PA.</p>

                      and that her parents died in mid-ocean while emmmigrating.
                      And that she and H.D. met because H.D. took a job working
                      for her guardian uncle in a bank. Which was a gret story,
                      except that she was born in IL, where her parents' graves
                      are located. But they were born in England, that part of
                      the story was correct.</p>
                    <p>Elizabeth and her daugheter, Frances, looked a lot a
                      like. It often takes me a while to figure out which one
                      I'm seeing in a photo. Her health seems to have been
                      frail. Methodist bishops usually relocate a minister after
                      7 years. When it became time for Rev. H.D. Goodrich to be
                      reassigned, he resigned instead, because of the support
                      network she had in Nelson -- and took a job as a mail
                      carrier. When she developed dementia, her carpenter
                      son-in-law, Lee Tubbs, built a house for H. D. &amp;
                      Elizabeth across the street from his and Mary's home in
                      Osceola. In her final years, weather permitting, she would
                      pack a trunk and sit on the front porch, waiting for her
                      brother to pick her up. </p>

                      was born 1832 in Fairfield, CT and died in Nelson, PA in
                      1888. We have several letters he wrote while in the Civil
                      Ward and extensive documentation from the Library of
                      Congress about his many attempts to get a disability
                      pension because of rheumatism he contracted by sleeping on
                      the ground. I was told that he was a doctor's assistant,
                      so I imagined him as one of the assistants working in
                      field hospitals, and stacking amputated arms and legs like
                      firewood. But from his applicatins, I learned that his job
                      was to take care of the doctor's horse. .</p>

                      involved in a tragic accident as a boy in Plattsburgh, NY.
                      He shot at a bird flying over with a .22 rifle. Unknown to
                      him, a neighbor kid was playing in the adjoining back
                      yard, but hidden by a high fence. When the bullet came

                      ask my father the question; he'd pause; and then reply,
                      "That's one of the things my brother knows." He owned and
                      operated a hardware store in Chandler, NC. My mother was
                      very judgemental about Maurice's "You've got to go along
                      to get along" attitude toward segregation. She saw that as
                      a moral failure on his part. Not to condone segregation,
                      but in all fairness, if he had ignored the "Jim Crow" laws
                      and customs regarding segregation, he would have been seen
                      as a "Damn Yankee" and soon gone out of business. </p>

                      know way too little about my grandfather, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47214">
                        Walter F. Thompson</a> (ca1865 - 1895). I know he was
                      born in England, died of TB in Plattsburgh, NY and was a
                      violinist in NYC. But that's about it. I kick myself that
                      I never asked my Bulley great-aunts and great-uncle about
                      him.</p>

                      usually was a man of few words, but had a dry sense of
                      humor. As a kid, I was fascinated by the workroom in which
                      Lee repair watches. The walls were covered with clocks.

                        Lee Tubbs</a>, They felt they needed to have some

                      born in 1880 and she was born in 1885. In 1905 they saw
                      and add for a logging camp that wanted to hire a cook and
                      also a teamster to drive their horse drawn lumber wagons.

                      our Schoharie Co. German ancestors and their experiences
                      during French and Indian War raids, to our Danish
                      ancestors, and (along with my ggf, Wm. Hoyt) to our Dutch
                      ancestors. She was b. 1810 in Delaware Co. NY (in or near
                      Davenport) to Conrad and Hulda Rowe Burgett (Conrad's
                      father was Hendrick Burghardt) and died 1886 in Nelson. In
                      1829 she married David Goodrich with whom she had 5
                      children: James, Charles, Ephorcene GOODRICH Ames, H.D,
                      &amp; Viola GOODRICH Slocum. Reportedly she often said,
                      "Now H.D., you let Viola be." </p>
                    <p> David Goodrich was a grocer in Davenport, NY who got
                      into a bitter rivalry with his brother Timothy, who was
                      also a grocer there. David lost, went broke, died in 1846
                      and was buried in a potters' field. After struggling to
                      support herself and her children, in 1857 she married
                      widower Isaac Van Tuyl, formerly of Davenport, and she and
                      her children moved to Campville, NY (on the north bank of
                      the Susquehanna, just west of the Broome Co. line. Isaac
                      died in 1864 and she moved to Nelson, PA where her sons,
                      James Goodrich and Charles Burget Goodrich had settled.
                      (James was a butcher and Charles an innkeeper). Sabrina
                      was buried in the lovliest section of the Nelson Cem.
                      under huge spruce trees and with a high monument. (I'll
                      look for a photo of the monument.) The Army Corp of Eng.
                      moved her grave to the N.W. corner of the cemetery as part
                      of the Cowanesque Lake Project. Aparently her sons were't
                      fond of their step-father, because neither the cemetery
                      monument nor her obituary mention the name Van Tuyl --
                      she's referenced as "Sabrina Burget Goodrich."</p>

                      together in 9 Mile Swamp. He taught himself to flake

                      fascinating stories about the Siege of Bastogne and of

                      never felt much warmth behind it. There was always a
                      rivalry between her and my mother. As the eldest, mom
                      became "Poppa's little girl." I suspect that Betty found
                      "being naughty" an effective way of getting attention. Mom
                      was prim and proper. Betty seemed to delight in shocking
                      or being vulgar to embaras mom. She was a good corporate
                      wife, joining Roy at the country club when he wined and
                      dined customers of prospects. Or being hostess.</p>
                    <p>Roy was part of that competition. He attempted to be a
                      suitor of my mother's, and switched his attentions to
                      Betty when mom wasn't interested in him.</p>
                    <p>It seems harsh to say, but Betty always seemed to me to
                      be rather shallow. That she didn't share my mother's
                      intellect or general curiosity. She (and her mother)
                      always seemed to me more "party girls." </p>

                        fellow, well met</a>." He was a "back slapper," a "glad
                      hander," a "joiner." He was a freight agent for the
                      Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad so his social
                      life and business life were inextricably mixed. He was
                      always on the lookout for potential customers and that was
                      a factor in his involvement in the Rotary, Kiwanis,
                      Optimist Club, Masons and Shriners. I said "a factor"
                      because he was genuinely proud of the community service
                      those organization provided. I think he was naturally
                      friendly. And he always treated me well. We gave our
                      second son the middle name 'Roy,' because both my wife and
                      I had fond memories of an uncle named "Roy." One of the
                      distinctive things about him was the "bear hugs" with

                    <p>I later learned from some female relatives that during
