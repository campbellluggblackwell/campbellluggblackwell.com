          <p> As the days roll around and it comes time for another letter for
            the C.C.C., I can't help but draw a long sigh and think to myself,
            "What shall I write about?" When I received Cousin <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Young-32984">
              Roswell Young</a>'s letter yesterday, giving the fourth generation
            such a send off about being always behind with their letters, it
            made me feel as if I'd like to have a special roundup of our
            generation - and make everyone of them promise from now on to be on
            time with their letters. If any of you happen to be listening in on
            your radio, I hope you'll catch my thought wave, "Let's show 'em." </p>
          <p> I received a letter from Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will
              Selph</a> a short time ago. Was glad to hear from him, even though
            his letter was rather "businessfied". I was terribly sorry to learn
            from his letter that three of the cousins had been called away since
            our last exchange of letters. The first thing I did was to get out
            my correspondence books and look up the letters and pictures of
            those three cousins. How badly we all would feel if their pictures
            and letters were not in the books, and how much more necessary it is
            for us - "slackers" - to get busy and see to it that before another
            exchange of letters anyone who hasn't his picture in one of the
            books should send it in, and I'm sure Cousin Will Selph will find a
            place to paste it in. I'm guilty, but I'm going to stand up before
            somebody's camera this next summer, and I'll try to drag along the
            rest of my family. Let's have another book of pictures - what do you
            say? I'm not the only guilty one - so now the rest of you get
            "shot", too. </p>
          <p class="HasFootnote"> I got the loveliest box of yellow jonquils and
            red tulips from "Georgiana Gardens", <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper,_Washington">Harper,
              Washington</a>. They came all unexpectedly, and were surely a glad
            surprise. They came through in fine shape, and were scarcely wilted
            at all. Brother Edd sent them. Perhaps some of you already know that
            my brother, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hughey-1584">
              Edd Hughey</a>, has gone into partnership with <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Congdon-802">
              Georgia Congdon</a> <span class="footnote"><span class="fnHide">

              each other from their childhood days in Brainerd, MN.<span class="fnHide">)</span></span>,
            and is helping her raise flowers for the market. I hope they won't
            forget to write their C.C.C. letters, and tell us all about their
            flowers, and their families and everything else of interest. </p>

          <p> I am wondering if Cousins <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed</a>
            and <a href="VaughanEmma1854.html">Em Congdon</a> attended the
            Campbell Reunion at Cousin <a href="CongdonCharles1856.html">Charlie
              Congdon</a>'s last fall; also, if they spent the winter in
            California as they said they expected to do. I hope everybody will
            write long newsy letters this time. Cousin Charlie visited us
            Minnesota folks about a year ago. It surely seemed good to see him.
            I couldn't see that he had changed in appearance except maybe his
            hair was a little whiter. </p>
          <p class="HasFoonote"> In reading and in rereading the C.C.C. letters
            as I have done in the past year, I took special notice to see how
            many different professions are represented among the cousins. Seems
            as though there is one of every kind of profession, but as a whole
            we are mostly all a class of farmers. I can remember lots of things
            <a href="CampbellElizabeth1830.html">Grandma</a> used to tell of
            things that happened when she was a girl. <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Great-grandfather
              Campbell</a> was a farmer, and by what Grandma said, was very
            strict. Everyone of the Campbell sisters had to learn to knit their
            own stockings, and wash and card and spin the flax to be woven into
            long lengths of linen and then colored with shumack <span class="footnote"><span

                class="fnHide"> (Footnote: </span>A phonetic spelling of the <a

                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumac">sumac</a> shrub/tree.<span

                class="fnHide">)</span></span> or some such juice, and then made
            into their Sunday dresses. Sunday morning found every member of the
            family in church. Sunday morning golf or baseball wasn't thought of
            in those days. Why can't we of today pattern after the ways of
            [Great]-Grandfather Campbell? Slang wasn't allowed around where he
            was. </p>
          <p> Grandma related an incident that took place one day when she was a
            girl. They had sweet corn for dinner, and after the meal was over
            her sisters, <a href="CampbellSarah1824.html">Sally</a>, <a href="CampbellJane1834.html">Jane</a>,
            <a href="CampbellPhebe1832.html">Phoebe</a>, <a href="CampbellEleanor1828.html">Eleanor</a>,
            <a href="CampbellMaryAnn1826.html">Mary Ann</a>, and the others all
            piled their empty cobs at Grandma's plate, and then some one made
            the remark, "Oh, see all the corn that Lib ate!" Grandma replied, "I
            hope to die, I didn't eat all of that." Then, she said, Grandfather
            marched her out to the woodshed and gave her the worst whipping she
            ever got for saying "I hope to die". Our youngsters of today would
            think it very queer to be punished for such a small offense, but I
            imagine that it looked like a big offense to Grandfather Campbell.
            Perhaps if we could be more like him, there wouldn't be quite as
            much slang used today. </p>
          <p> Cousin <a href="SelphJennie1873.html">Jennie Cady</a> promised to
            relate some stories that Aunt Jane used to tell. Let's hear them
            Jennie! I want to pat <a href="ShipmanMabel1875.html">Mabel Shaw</a>
            on the back for her letter written in rhyme. Well done, Cousin
            Mabel! It surely was good. I see by Cousin <a href="CampbellThomas1856.html">Tommie
              Campbell</a>'s letter that we are all invited to spend a winter in
            St. Petersburg. Do you suppose he could take care of all of us in
            his big hotel? And would he give us free board? Let's go - before he
            pulls in the latch string <span class="footnote"><span class="fnHide">
                (Footnote: </span> Pioneer cabins did not have door knobs or
              locks. On the inside, there was a short bar, permanently fastened
              at one end, so that it could pivot. The other end was free to fall
              into a slot built to hold it securely and prevent someone outside
              from opening the door. In order to get back in when one left the
              house, a string was tied to the pivoting bar, put through a small
              hole in the door and left hanging outside. To get back in the
              house, you jut lifted the latch string.<span class="fnHide">)</span></span>

          <p> I notice by the different letters from Nelson and Osceola that the
            weather there is about the same as the weather here in Minnesota. In
            referring back to a year ago, different ones speak of seeing robins,
            and making maple sugar and doing their spring housecleaning. Well,
            we are doing the same things here in Minnesota today. I saw several
            robins this morning. My neighbors are talking "maple syrup". We took
            the bees out of the cellar today. They surly are having a great old
            fly. The air seems to be full of them. We cleaned a big pan full of
            fish for dinner. The were caught through the ice near the shore. The
            fish will soon be going up the creeks, and then we can get a load of
            them. They are fine smoked. </p>
          <p> The ice hasn't gone out of the lakes yet, but in another couple of
            weeks I think it will have disappeared. The frost is going out, and
            cars get stuck in the mud in the low places, but taken as a whole,
            the roads are good. You can even see dust behind the cars 'most any
            place. </p>
          <p> I was called to the home of one of my neighbors yesterday morning
            before daylight, to help out, but it proved to be nothing very
            serious, or of any consequence, so I won't take the space to tell
            about it, but I must tell you what the doctor said. </p>
          <p> We were speaking of the cyclones and windstorms in the Southern
            States, and of the fifteen feet of snow in Winnipeg, Canada, and the
            doctor said, "Folks, we are living in God's Country, a streak from
            coast to coast, where we have neither floods, nor tornados <span class="Annotation">[sic]</span>,
            nor blizzards <span class="footnote"><span class="fnHide">
                (Footnote: </span> No blizzards in central MN???<span class="fnHide">)</span></span>,
            nor earthquakes. Everybody is well and happy, with a few exceptions.
            Let's rap on wood." Why go to Florida, and be blown away in a
            tornado? But I would like to go to Harper, Washington, and help Edd
            and Georgia pick flowers. </p>
          <p> I notice that Cousin George Buck's <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Knabjohann-1">
              wife</a> is interested in the Parent-Teacher Association. Well, so
            am I, and I am still busy and interested in our Farmers Club. I am a
            member of the Program Committee, and it means a lot of work, but I
            feel that we are all well repaid for our effort. Our County Agent is
            organizing a "Calf Club" for our youngsters, and our son, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Taylor-55969">
              William</a>, twelve years old, is going to compete with the other
            boys and girls in raising a Guernsey heifer calf to be taken to the
            County Fair next fall. William hopes to raise the best calf in the
            lot. </p>

              Irma</a>, who is sixteen years old, is a Camp Fire Girl. She is
            working for honors, and earning beads and insignia to put upon her

            gave a banquet for their fathers and mothers last Saturday night,
            March twenty-first. It was the thirteenth anniversary of the
            organization of Camp Fire Girls here. They had a three course diner,
            and a huge birthday cake, and then gave a splendid program telling
            all about what it means to be a Camp Fire Girl. The mothers and
            fathers enjoyed the banquet and entertainment immensely. Wish I had

          <p> Our last list of letters took up the space of one hundred pages.
            Now, with our membership raised to eighty cousins, how will our

            all the cousins are well and happy, and that each one will write his
            letter. Do it now, for by another year some of us may not be here. I
            took time off today to write this letter, although my conscience
            tells me I should be ironing and churning and getting my work done
            up, so that I can go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosby,_Minnesota">Crosby</a>
            tomorrow with butter and eggs. </p>
          <p> I have seven hen turkeys, and a nice gobbler, Mammoth Bronze,
            added to my flock of poultry. Any one wanting a job at herding
            turkeys this summer, please send in his application. </p>
          <p> If any if the cousins happen to be motoring through Minnesota this
            coming summer, just swing around in the direction of Brainerd and
            Deerwood. We will give you a hearty welcome - have a picnic, and all
            go fishing. </p>
          <p> Love and best regards to all the cousins, </p>
