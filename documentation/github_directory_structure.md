The group site is here:

https://github.com/campbellluggblackwell

Within that site, there is a Repository:

https://github.com/campbellluggblackwell/campbellluggblackwell.com

.  Because you are reading this file, you are likely in that repository.  Be sure not to confuse this repository with
   the actual campbellluggblackwell.com site.  You add and make changes to files here.  They are then published to the
   actual site.

The repository has the following directories:

  - .github/workflows
  - documentation
  - old_rootsweb_website
  - scripts
  - website

These are explained (out of order) below:

## /website
This directory contains all the files for the website.  If you change files or add/remove files in this directory, that change
is automatically applied to the actual BlueHost website.
