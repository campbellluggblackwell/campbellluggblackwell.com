I am not using this script, but it should still work.


#!/usr/bin/expect
spawn sftp -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss [lindex $argv 0]@ftp.campbellluggblackwell.com
# The first call, need to confirm its ok to connect
expect { 
    "Are you sure" { 
        send "yes\r"
        expect "ssword:"
        send "[lindex $argv 1]\r"
    }
    "ssword:" {
        send "[lindex $argv 1]\r"
    }
}
expect "ftp>"
send "cd public_html\r"
expect "ftp>"
send "mget [lindex $argv 2] .\r"
expect "ftp>"
sleep 2
send "bye\r"
