                <p> If you've read the previous chapters you already have read a
                  lot about me. There's no need to duplicate any of that in this
                  section. But I've placed miscellaneous thoughts here as the
                  spirit moved me.</p>
                <h4> Civil Rights Movement </h4>
                <p> I'm sure I would have gotten involved in the Civil Rights
                  movement, one way or another. But my path resulted from
                  conversations with a sort of neighbor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lewis_Moore">William
                    L. Moore</a>. I forget how we first met, but he knew my
                  siblings, perhaps from when they'd lived in Park Terrace
                  Heights, adjoining Binghamton to the south, which is where he
                  lived. He was a postal worker and took the bus to and from
                  work. I lived about half way between the end of the bus line
                  and his house. In warm weather I'd often be doing yard work
                  when he came by. It was all uphill to his house, so if I
                  waved, he'd be glad to take a break and enjoy a glass of cold
                  lemonade. He was well read and had many interests, so there
                  was lots to talk about, including his 1955 book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lewis_Moore"><u>The
                      Mind In Chains: Autobiography of a Schizophrenic</u></a>.
                  He thought the way shock treatments were done was pretty
                  barbaric. A family friend of ours had recently had them and
                  underwent major personality changes as a result, so I was
                  interested in learning about it. I wouldn't call him a friend,
                  we never socialized other than these chats, but we were
                  friendly acquaintances and I think both enjoyed our chats.</p>
                <p>I was shocked when I read of his death as a civil rights
                  martyr. My wife and I went to his memorial service and were
                  impressed with the way the Rev. Woodward, a
                  Unitarian-Universalist, dealt respectfully with Bill's atheist
                  beliefs. When a local chapter of <a hewd="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Racial_Equality">C.O.R.E.</a>
                  formed and named itself the "William L. Moore Chapter," we
                  joined (as did Rev. Woodward). I won't bore you with all of
                  the activities, just mention a couple highlights. I previously
                  mentioned having to jump out of the way when someone
                  deliberately drove a car into a picket line I was in. (No one
                  was hurt, we all managed to jump in time.) That protest
                  happened to involve a classmate I knew from college.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
                    href="#India" id="India-ref"></a> He was from southern India
                  and had dark skin. He'd applied for a job as cook at a local
                  diner, and the owner took one look one look at his skin color
                  and turned him down -- a violation of NYS law. Leaders of our
                  chapter talked to the owner, who was adamant. There was no way
                  they were going to hire a "colored" cook. Eventually we ended
                  the picketing and sit-in and helped file a complaint with the
                  state Civil Rights Commission.</p>
                <p>My main activity with the Chapter involved being chair of
                  their Housing committee. Binghamton had a small
                  African-American community, most of them descendants of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Railroad">underground
                    railroad</a> escaped slaves, and having lived in the area
                  for generations, has no discernible accent when calling on the
                  phone. People would come to us for help after they'd made an
                  appointment to see a house or apartment and were told, "Sorry
                  it's just been rented (or sold)," but doubted the claim. We
                  would arrange for two teams, a couple each, to test the
                  situation. A black couple would schedule an appointment, and a
                  white couple would schedule an appointment shortly after. The
                  black couple would show up and be given the "It's just been
                  rented/sold" story. And then the white couple would follow up
                  and, miraculously, the apartment/house was magically
                  available. (The name of the woman who usually went with me as
                  my wife actually was "Mrs. Thompson.") When we confronted the
                  landlord/agent sometimes they'd relent knowing they'd been
                  caught red handed. Often they'd make an excuse, such as, "I'm
                  not prejudice, but if I rent to them my other tenants will
                  leave." We would negotiate with them, offer help, and try to
                  resolve the problem. Sometimes we'd help file a complaint.
                  Occasionally they would be hard-line segregationists and say,
                  "OK then, I'll just take it off the market."</p>
                <p>While in CORE I met two especially memorable people, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Farmer">James
                    Farmer, Jr.</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Peck_%28pacifist%29">James
                    Peck</a>. Farmer was an inspirational presence, radiating
                  calm confidence. He had a great achievement as a teenager,
                  portrayed by actor Denzel Whitaker in Denzel Washington's 2007
                  biographical drama, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Debaters#:%7E:text=The%20Great%20Debaters%20is%20a,1997%20issue%20of%20American%20Legacy.">
                    <u>The Great Debaters</u></a>, which I strongly recommend
                  watching. James Peck was a more tragic figure. He played a big
                  part in the 1964 <a href="https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/freedom-summer">Freedom
                    Summer</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Freedom-Rides">Freedom
                    Rides</a>. In 1963, before we went to the March on
                  Washington for Jobs and Freedom, he came to our chapter and
                  conducted a course on passive resistance and how to cover out
                  heads for protection if beaten by night sticks. Fortunately I
                  never had to test the training. But it was inadequate to the
                  viscous attacks he was subjected to in '64. (If you search his
                  name on the Internet you will see lots of pictures of his
                  bleeding head (later bandaged head.) I don't think he ever
                  fully recovered. I met Farmer and Peck twice and got to chat
                  with them both times. In my second meeting with Peck, he
                  understandably seemed a bitter man.</p>
                <h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Washington_for_Jobs_and_Freedom">1963
                    March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom</a> </h4>
                <p>Two busloads went from our C.O.R.E. chapter.We didn't know
                  what to expect. In many ways, Washington, DC was still a
                  "southern city" and segregated. As mentioned above, we were
                  trained in passive resistance - not knowing what to expect
                  from local police or from KKK counter demonstrators. As we
                  approached the route of the march, it was comforting to see
                  National Guardsmen lining the streets. Just a single line of
                  them, but on both sides of the streets. (We didn't know that
                  their rifles were loaded with blanks.) Some of them may have
                  been KKK members, but their presence was comforting anyway. It
                  made it seem less likely that KKK thugs would attack the
                  marchers. It was well organized. The bus drivers knew just
                  where to go and told us where to find them for our return.
                  Volunteer "march marshals" helped direct everyone where to go
                  -- which units were assembling where. We had a great vantage
                  point, and could watch the marchers pass by, while waiting for
                  our turn to join the march. Each unit carried banners
                  identifying what organization they were with or what union
                  local. I could hear the speeches via amplifiers mounted on
                  light poles -- and recognize many prominent figures at the
                  front of their units: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dubinsky">Dave
                    Dubinsky</a> of the Garment Workers Union. And the UAW's <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Reuther">Walter</a>
                  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_G._Reuther">Victor
                    Reuther</a>. And on and on. Countless ministers, priests,
                  rabbis and nuns from every faith group you can think of. The
                  marchers move slowly because of congestion at the Mall. So we
                  got to see many of the speakers and performers as we crept
                  past the grandstand. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter,_Paul_and_Mary">Peter,
                    Paul and Mary</a> performed for us. And I was thrilled to
                  see and hear two of the days organizers whom I had long
                  admired, the inspirational <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayard_Rustin">Bayard
                    Rustin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Philip_Randolph">A.
                    Philip Randolph</a>. We were on the opposite side of the
                  pool and out of sight of the speakers when Dr. Martin Luther
                  King, Jr. gave his largely impromptu "I have a Dream Speech,"
                  but someone had a portable radio we heard it on. Of course I
                  knew of Dr. King from his involvement in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_bus_boycott">Montgomery
                    Bus Boycott</a>. But I went home thinking that the great
                  speech of the day, that would become famous, was the one
                  Bayard Rustin gave. (That's not the first time I've been
                  wrong.) I wanted to participate in the 50th anniversary of the
                  March but had some kind of a conflict. I probably can't walk
                  far enough to participate in future ones and am reluctant to
                  do it in a wheelchair, but a multi-passenger golf cart might
                  be OK.</p>
                <h4> Community Organizing and Community Service </h4>
                <p>I'm proud of my efforts at community organizing, but don't
                  think of any stories that would interest you. I did quite a
                  bit of community service such as: serving on the Johnson City,
                  NY Library Board and the Binghamton-Johnson City Joint Sewage
                  Board (that may sound funny, but clean waters have always been
                  important to me since my childhood memories of dodging
                  floating feces while swimming in the Susquehanna River); Asst.
                  Scoutmaster, chair of the Common Cause chapter for our
                  Congressional District, member of NAACP, C.O.R.E. and peace

                <h4> Civic Engagement in Partisan Politics </h4>
                <p> I started out intending to be an Independent, even though
                  all in my family had been Republicans ever since Lincoln ran
                  for president. One of my mother's earliest memories was of
                  marching in a torchlight parade for McKinley's election. I
                  wasn't 21 yet, so I couldn't register for the 1956 election,
                  but in campus snack bar discussions I supported maverick
                  Republican <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Javits">Jacob
                    Javits</a>' run for US Senate -- and when I could register a
                  few weeks later, did so as an Independent. I have always
                  believed that one party dominance in an area leads to
                  stagnation, cronyism, and party hacks being selected for
                  office because they'll "go along." And that competition
                  between parties is essential to good government. Republicans
                  dominated in that area<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#BillyHill"
                    id="BillyHill-ref"></a>, so when I wanted to vote in a
                  primary and had to enroll in a party, I picked the underdog
                  Democrats.</p>
                <p>In 1959, a friend of mine got involved in the campaign or one
                  his coworkers, who was running for city council and recruited
                  my help. Our candidate lost, but I learned a lot about the
                  mechanics of grassroots campaigns. The next year, 1960, I
                  enthusiastically worked for John F. Kennedy's presidential
                  campaign, having experienced his charisma first hand.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
                    href="#JFK" id="JFK-ref"></a> I became a member of the
                  county Democratic Committee and did "grunt work" for JFK's
                  campaign -- knocking on doors, handing out campaign literature
                  and Get Out The Vote efforts on election day. A different
                  friend urged me to also get involved in the mayoral campaign
                  in the adjacent village of Johnson City. A former Latin
                  teacher, then HS guidance counselor he admired was running and
                  needed all the help I could get. I met Jim McCabe, was
                  impressed, and happily volunteered with his campaign too.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
                    href="#McCabe" id="McCabe-ref"></a></p>
                <p>You all know how JFK's campaign turned out. Jim McCabe lost
                  by a landslide, but he wasn't phased -- "I got my name out
                  before the voters. I'll do better next time." He kept running
                  until he won, and continued on to become a member of the state
                  house and finally, the state senate. He was a fine man, a
                  friend, and someone I was proud to have helped.</p>
                <p>I was active in elections for decades, as Democratic party
                  chair of a Binghamton ward. A county committee in PA, a member
                  of a Congressional candidate's campaign committee, poll
                  watcher, poll worker, etc. And met many Congressmen and other
                  public officials in the process (including a Supreme Court
                  Justice, Speaker of the House, etc. of whom the most
                  interesting was Sen. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy">Robert

                <h4> What I Learned From Life </h4>
                <p>Whatever wisdom I have, is a result of countless mistakes. I
                  don't have many pearls of wisdom to share. Perhaps the most
                  important are: </p>
                <ul class="w3-ul" style="font-family:Oswald;">
                  <li>EVERYONE'S THE SAME. We all have the same wants and fears.
                    Basic physical needs such as food, shelter and the other
                    necessities of life. And emotional needs such as love,
                    recognition, etc. We all want better lives and opportunities
                    for our children; &amp;</li>
                  <li>EVERYONE'S DIFFERENT. People have different motivators.
                    For some it's money. For others it may be fame, recognition
                    or fancy job titles. For others it may be a chance to pursue
                    one's dreams, or self-expression, or a cozy nest, a chance
                    to learn --- or whatever. The key is accepting that everyone
                    doesn't respond to the same set of <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/carrot-and-stick">carrots
                      and sticks</a> that you do. </li>
                  <li>I DON'T BELIEVE IN: destiny, karma, or fate, or that the
                    universe knows or cares about our existence. So no "it was
                    meant to be" or "everything happens for a reason."</li>
                  <li>I DO BELIEVE: that life is brief and precious; in the
                    importance of "the now;" in the role of chance (it's a world
                    of probabilities, not certainties); in the importance of
                    being kind to each other and that small acts of kindness may
                    ripple out far farther and longer than you imagine; in the
                    importance of keeping an open mind; in respecting knowledge
                    and evidence; learning to forgive yourself; that the perfect
                    is the enemy of the good; in the importance of not losing
                    hope; and that most people want to do the right thing most
                    of the times.</li>
                </ul>

              <p>(Sit-in) He was a somewhat tragic person. I remember in our
                freshman and sophomore years he would talk enthusiastically
                about how he would gain loads of knowledge in his studies and
                could return to his rural village and help them enter the 20th
                century. But one day (I think in his junior year) he was on the
                brink of tears. My recollection is that he said something like
                "I can't go back. I wanted to help them. But I just can't face
                it. The dirt floors. The flies. The heat. I just can't."<a href="#India-ref"

              <p>(Party choice) Broome County politics were dominated by former

                  Hill</a> (see also <a href="https://www.pressconnects.com/story/news/connections/history/2019/07/27/life-and-times-broome-political-journalism-giant-william-hill/1807356001/">article</a>).
                To his credit, he didn't believe party organizations should take
                sides in primaries, but they did make sure that "amenable"
                candidates filed for office -- whom it seemed to me often had

              <p>(JFK) A year or two earlier I had visited the US Capitol
                Building, and happened to ride on an elevator on the Senate
                side. Our car was almost full and the doors started to close,
                but then opened as one more passenger entered -- Sen. John F.
                Kennedy. I don't recall him uttering a word, just smiling and
                nodding to the other passengers. But his charisma was palpable.
                (My mother would have said, "He had 'presence'.") All the women
                swooned. And the men seemed to feel his spell too.<a href="#JFK-ref"

            </li>
            <li id="McCabe">
              <p>(McCabe) James Walter McCabe, Sr., (1917 - 1999) was a fine man
                and great public servant. When he started running for mayor of
                Johnson City, NY he seemed somewhat introverted. "<a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/work+the+room">Working
                  the room</a>" and "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=glad+handing+meaning&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS912US912&amp;oq=gladhanding&amp;aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0i10i131i433i512j0i10i512l4j0i30j0i10i15i30l2j0i10i30.10809j0j9">glad-handing</a>"
                didn't come naturally to him. But each time he ran he became
                better at it. And his percentage of the vote increased. He never
                pandered to an audience. Or "<a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/soft-pedal">soft
                  pedaled</a>" his views. It was "this is what I believe; this
                is what I'll work for if elected. Voters appreciated his candor
                and his integrity. He served several terms as mayor, and before
                serving in the state house and senate. A post office is named in
                his honor.</p>
              <p> When I first started helping with his campaign, I encountered
                some resistance among his campaign volunteers, some of whom
                viewed me as a "carpetbagger" because I didn't live in the
                village. We were expecting a child and had to move to a larger
                apartment anyway, so we moved to Johnson City and I became a
                County Committeeman from there and became active in the Johnson
                City Democratic Club. And then president of the club and
                chairman of the Johnson City Democratic Committee. I like to
                think that I helped make it more effective and a force for
                bettering the community. I served on several of Jim's campaign
                committees and was treasurer of one. Some of the civil service
                appointees anticipated having to "kickback" a percentage of
                their salary to the party or campaigns. And some contributors
                tried to contribute "brown bags" full of cash. I don't know what
                kinds of corruption may or may not have gone on in previous
                administrations. But we worked hard to make sure everything was
                done "by the book" -- scrupulously avoiding the slightest hint
                of impropriety.<a href="#McCabe-ref" aria-label="Back to content">↵</a></p>
            </li>
            <li id="RFK">
              <p>(RFK) As I mentioned, I met many interesting politicians. One
                that stuck in my mind was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_Clark">Ramsey
                  Clark</a>. (I suspect that Ramsey Clark, who grew up in TX,
                was the only candidate for US Senator for NY that came to
                fund-raising gatherings wearing cowboy boots and a string tie.)</p>
              <p>But by far the most memorable was Sen. Robert Kennedy. I find
                his transformation from being a spoiled rich kid and supporter
                of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy">Sen.
                  Joseph McCarthy</a>, to ruthless opponent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Hoffa">Jimmy
                  Hoffa</a>, to (I believe) a champion of the downtrodden. I
                think a key moment in his transformation was his 1960 trip to
                West Virginia as an advance-man for his brother's primary. There
                he came face to face with Appalachia's poverty -- a completely
                different world from the super-affluent Hyannisport world he
                grew up in. Unlike Ebeneezer Scrooge, his transformation wasn't
                overnight. But West Virginia's poverty opened his eyes and
                launched his journey. I don't know if when he first became
                senator he believed the speeches that were written for him, but
                by the time I met him I think what he said and what he believed
                were in sync. I met him twice. He'd fly into the local airport.
                And meet with local political leaders for a pep talk and
                listening session. Both times I got to chat with him (and 4 or 5
                members of the audience) afterward. I can't remember a word of
                those conversations or even the topics. But he listened well,
                asked good questions, and I feel I got a much better insight
                into him and his thinking during those face-to-face moments. If
                he'd lived to become president, I believe his legacy would have
                been more substantial than his brother's.<a href="#RFK-ref" aria-label="Back to content">↵</a></p>
