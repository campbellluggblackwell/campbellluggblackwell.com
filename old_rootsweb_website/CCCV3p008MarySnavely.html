        <div class="Message w3-margin-left w3 margin-right">
          <p> Since writing the last letter to the Campbell Cousins Club, many
            changes have come to us. </p>
          <p>During the past year it has been our very great pleasure to have a
            short visit from some of the Cousins. In October Cousin <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1477">Carrie
              Campbell</a> paid her first visit to Washington, and stopped with
            us for ten days. She was a wonderful house guest, and proved herself
            to be a silver lining to the cloud that was hovering over our house.
            We enjoyed her stay to the fullest extent, and were sorry indeed
            when the "Goodbyes" were said. On November fifteenth we were
            delighted to have Cousins <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I787">Lish</a>
            and <a href="CampbellKate1853.html">Kate Horton</a> stop with us on
            their way to St. Petersburg. With them came a guest who spent four
            months with us.</p>
          <p><a href="BosardAnna1860.html">Aunt Anna Owlett</a>, after the death
            of <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1102">Uncle
              Andrew</a>, was prevailed upon to pay us a visit. She came into
            our home and our lives as a ministering angel, when we needed her
            more than ever before. While there were many things to mar our
            happiness, we did some sightseeing, and had many pleasant times
            together, and we were sorry to say "Goodbye", when she was obliged
            to go home.</p>
          <p>During Aunt Anna's stay we had a short visit from Cousins <a href="CongdonThomas1850.html">Ed</a>
            and <a href="VaughanEmma1854.html">-m Congdon</a>, who were also on
            their way to St. Petersburg. We are hoping for a longer visit with
            all of the cousins who went south when they fly<sup>1</sup> north
            again.</p>
          <p>After an illness of eight months, our good <a href="CraneJennie1852.html">Mother</a>
            went Home<sup>2</sup> February third. Cousin <a href="SelphWilliam1871.html">Will
              Selph</a> came to Washington for the funeral, and it was surely a
            great comfort to have him and Aunt Anna with us at that time.</p>
          <p>It has been a source of great consolation to us to receive so much
            attention from <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1048">Father</a>'s
            kin. They have all shown their love and loyalty to Mother and her
            family through the years that we have been without him, and the
            recent added sorrow has only emphasized their kindness to us all. </p>

          <p>1. "Fly" is being used figuratively, as in migrating birds. This
            was before the term "snowbirds" had been coined. Commercial aviation
            was in it's infancy. Not till the Air Commerce Act of 1926, did
            Congress address licensing of pilots and aircraft; and establishing
            navigation aids and air routes.</p>

          <p>When at last Aunt Anna felt that she must turn toward home, Cousin
            Will and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I1604">Edith
              Selph</a> invited her to visit them in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maplewood,_New_Jersey">
              Maplewood</a>. I will not infringe upon the privilege of the
            others in telling their part of that chapter, but I must add this
            much to my letter. They also invited me to accompany her to New York
            and Maplewood. So, after waiting in Washington to see President
            Coolidge inaugurated on March seventh, we sallied forth. Those of
            you who have visited Cousins Will and Edith and <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I13671">Mother
              Loder</a> do not need to be told of their wonderful hospitality,
            but for the benefit of the Cousins who have not enjoyed this
            pleasure, I must say that they have missed a rare treat. Our time
            was filled with one pleasant event followed by another in rapid
            succession. </p>
          <p>We found that Cousins <a href="BuckGeorge1877.html">George</a> and
            <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I927">Anna
              Buck</a> and their two splendid boys had been invited for dinner
            and the evening. Both were enjoyed immensely, then and afterward
            when they whisked me off to their home in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_New_Jersey">
              Madison</a> for the night and following Sunday, returning me to
            Maplewood in the evening. This added greatly to my pleasant visit.
            The New Jersey Cousins are surely wonderful entertainers, and I came
            home greatly refreshed by my trip. </p>
          <p>While we have had letters from nearly everyone of the Campbell
            Cousins proper<sup>3</sup> within the past two months, and many from
            the third generation<sup>4</sup>, we shall await with much pleasure
            the coming of the next edition of the Campbell Cousins
            Correspondence Club.</p>
