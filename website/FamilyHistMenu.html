          <h2><b>Our Story</b></h2>
          <p class="FirstP">This website is for the descendants of one pioneer
            couple, <a href="CampbellJoseph1748.html">Joseph</a> and <a href="HarperMary1749.html">Mary
              Harper</a> Campbell; and of associated families --- especially
            HAZLETTs, LUGGs and BLACKWELLs. They now have 10 generations of
            descendants. Our family tree <img src="https://spaces-cdn.clipsafari.com/iidi5u25v362hmp1a3fuzpsvfooo"

              style="width: 53px; height: 53px;"> now contains over 25,000
            individuals, with more than 4,500 surnames. Since the very
            beginning, our Campbells, Hazletts, Luggs and Blackwells have been
            intertwined. </p>
          <p> Enjoy exploring these pages, and be sure to contact us if you are
            a relative. We love hearing from "new" cousins we hadn't known of. </p>
          <p> [Cautionary note: Several different, unrelated, Campbell families
            came to Tioga Co., PA in the early 1800s. It's easy to get the
            various families mixed up. A few of us have ancestors in more than
            one of those Campbell lines.] </p>
          <p class="FirstP"> Our story starts with Joseph Campbell, "Sr." (born
            1748 in Scotland) and wife Mary Harper (born 1749 in Scotland) who
            lived for a while in County Antrim and Londonderry in North Ireland
            before emmigrating. The men reportedly worked at the Belfast Iron
            Works before coming to the US. </p>
          <p> They pronounced their name as "CAM-uhl", <img alt="Drawing of a camel"

              src="camel-silhouette.svg" style="width: 60px; height: 66px;"> not
            as "CAMP-bell" or "CAM-bul". (When the surname was created, almost
            800 years ago, it was spelled 'Cambell.') </p>
          <p> The first member of the family known to come to America was
            Joseph's younger brother <a href="CampbellJohn1761.html">John
              Campbell</a>, b. 1761 in Scotland. He came about 1776 to
            Philadelphia, where he was first a tailor, a land agent, and
            eventually a miller. </p>
          <p> The rest of our Campbells, the Hazletts, the Luggs, and the
            Blackwells immigrated in dribs and drabs over the years --- the
            last&nbsp; (<a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Lugg-47">Chas. B.
              Lugg</a> &amp; family) in 1833. </p>
          <p> For a timeline and details, see <a href="WhoCameWhen.html">Who
              Came When</a> (it covers Campbells, Hazletts, Luggs and
            Blackwells). </p>
          <p> By the very early 1800s, some of Joseph and Mary's older children
            had settled in Lancaster Co., PA. Their oldest son, <a href="CampbellJohn1781.html">John
              Campbell</a> (b. 1781) soon moved to the Pittsburgh area. Eldest
            daughter <a href="CampbellSarah1777.html">Sally</a> and son-in-law,
            <a href="HazlettSamuel1780.html">Sam Hazlett</a>, by 1806 may have
            moved from Lancaster Co. to a farm near Stroudsburg, PA. By 1810 Sam
            Hazlett, Joseph Campbell, "Sr." and his brother, John, completed
            land purchases in <a href="BeechersIsland.html">Beecher's Island</a>.
            Joseph and Mary Harper Campbell, plus their younger children, came
            to the US in the fall of 1810. </p>
          <p> Probably in late 1810, Joseph and Mary, accompanied by 5 of their
            8 children; 2 of their 3 Hazlett sons-in-law; Joseph's brother John;
            and their livestock migrated from son-in-law Sam Hazlett's farm in
            PA to Beecher's Island. Stories about their epic journey were
            recorded by granddaughter-in-law <span wc_id="I661"> <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Dunham-434">Lucy
                DUNHAM</a></span> Hazlett and others. </p>
          <p> The Campbells and Hazletts were among the first permanent settlers
            in the area. They rapidly multiplied. <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James</a>
            and <a href="BlackwellMary1806.html">Mary Blackwell</a> Campbell
            apparently had 13. <a href="CampbellJoseph1793.html">Joseph</a> and
            <a href="ClinchAnn1804.html">Ann Clinch</a> Campbell had 12
            children. <a href="HazlettJohn1787ca.html">John</a> and <a href="CampbellJane1792.html">Jane
              Campbell Hazlett</a> had 9. Sam and Sally Campbell Hazlett had 7.
            So they quickly populated a community and filled a school house. </p>
          <p> In 1893, <a href="CampbellPhebe1832.html">Phebe CAMPBELL</a> Hoyt
            organized the first Campbell Reunion (they liked to spell it
            "Re-union'). The reunions were held annually for 50 years. At their
            peak, more than 300 attended, including many Blackwells and Luggs.
            They were halted in WW2, but restarted in 2000 by Phebe's
            great-grandson, Bill Thompson. Some in one branch of the family
            (Joseph and Ann Clinch Campbell's line) found the reunions too big,
            and held separate Campbell Cousins Dinners, which were by invitation
            only, and primarily for the 21 first cousins who were Joseph and
            Ann's grandchildren. They had grown up together, and felt a strong
            bond to each other. Both events were held yearly, almost always near
            Nelson. Many of the Cousins Dinner attendees were also active in the
            "Re-unions". </p>
          <p> We have a wonderful repository of our family's history: The
            minutes of the Campbell Reunions; minutes of the Campbell Cousins
            Diners; early letters; four volumes of letters, <span style="font-style: italic;">The

            reunions. They're usually held in or near Nelson, PA in even
            numbered years. Because of COVID-19 2020 was be our first reunion
            that you could join us from your homes via Internet or land lines,
            thanks to videoconferencing via Zoom.com. We got to meet cousins
            from all over the country and from Canada for the first time. It's
            success inspired us to do it again in 2022. Join us at the <a href="ReunionNext.html">next
              one</a> to met cousins and a chance to connect to your "roots". </p>
