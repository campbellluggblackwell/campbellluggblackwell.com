      <h3>Orientation</h3>
      <p class="FirstP">The original map showed things as they were prior to the
        Cowanesque Lake Project. In the middle of the map, flowing from left to
        right is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowanesque_River">Cowanesque
          River</a> <span class="Annotation">[identified by #1]</span>. Running
        beside it is a red, dashed line that's PA Route 49 <span class="Annotation">[identified
          by #2]</span>. Elkland, PA is just out of sight to the left
        (upstream). Cowanesque Lake is just out of sight on the right
        (downstream). The New York State Line is just out of sight above.</p>
      <p> The large letters 'NELSON' are for Nelson Twp. Below it, the cluster
        of little black squares represent the houses of "old Nelson." The
        vertical row of houses slightly to the left of the 'L' in NELSON is
        Depot St. <span class="Annotation"> [enclosed in the "stadium" shape]</span>
        (the portion above Lakeview Drive remains). At the bottom of Depot St.,
        along the north bank of the river, is a row of houses which was Nelson's
        "main drag" before the hamlet's demolition. South of the river, and just
        above the present PA 49 is another row of houses, which was the old 49
        and Nelson's South Side <span class="Annotation">[identified by #3]</span>.
        '4' marks the location of the Nelson United Church, post office and fire
        hall.</p>
      <h3>Strait-Hazlett-Merritt Property </h3>
      <p><a href="HazlettSamuel1780.html">Samuel Hazlett</a>, <a href="CampbellJoseph1748.html">Joseph
          Campbell</a>'s son-in-law, purchased his original site form one of the
        2 first settlers, Daniel Strait. Early settler Daniel Strait only lived
        in the area briefly and after he moved on, Sam purchased his land -- 300
        acres at $5/acre. If you look above the 'S' in NELSON you will see <span

          style="font-style: italics;">Strait</span> Creek. If you follow the
        creek south and east you will see a circle enclosing a house and above
        it, the word "Cem." That cemetery was the original Campbell family
        burial ground, later known as the Paul Bennet Cem. Its contents were
        relocated to the north west corner of the Nelson Cemetery as part of the
        Cowanesque Lake Project.</p>
      <p>The house was at, or near the site of Daniel Strait's cabin and Sam
        Hazlett's first Tioga Co., Home. He sold the property to his brother <a

          href="HazlettJohn1787ca.html">John Hazlett.</a> It then went to John's
        daughter, <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I78">Eliza
          HAZLETT</a> Merritt. The property remained in the Merritt family's
        hands for generations. The last one born in that farmhouse was either <a

          href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I744">Clifford
          Merritt, Sr. or </a><a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I748">Gordon
          Merritt</a>.</p>
      <h3>Beecher-Campbell/Hazlett Property</h3>
      <p> The Beecher family settled on a small island in the Cowanesque River
        for a few years before selling to our Campbells and moving on. Their
        land and cabin were purchased by <a href="CampbellJohn1761.html">John
          Campbell</a>, <a href="CampbellJoseph1748.html">Joseph Campbell</a>,
        and possibly Sam Hazlett.</p>
      <p> If you look at the map, south-west of what was once Nelson Borough,
        and to the left of the word "COWANESQUE," you'll see where PA 49 crosses
        the river. The river curves south-east and then sharply north-east,
        forming a "V" that is wooded (green). Just below that is an island of
        green <span class="Annotation">[enclosed in an oval]</span> that I
        think was the Beechers' island. Coming to the island, from the
        south-west, is Thornbottom Creek <span class="Annotation">[marked with
          a star]</span>. Presumably the expanse of white river bottom land
        above the island and to the left of the "V" is the location of the
        "Thorn Bottom" mentioned by <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=capane&amp;id=I100">Enoch
          Blackwell Campbell</a> in the <a href="ReunionMinutes1893.html">minutes
          of the 1892 Campbell Reunion</a>.</p>
      <p>We know that when Sam Hazlett moved from the Strait homestead, he
        settled at the mouth of Thornbottom Creek, on the left bank and <a href="CampbellJames1798.html">James
          Campbell</a> on the right bank of the creek. The elder Joseph Campbell
        apparently settled on the island. John Campbell settled on the river,
        building a grist mill and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulling">fulling
          mill</a>. His mill pond came to be known as "Losey's Pond." The
        younger Joseph lived on the south bank or the river, near the island.</p>
      <h3>Community of Beecher's Island</h3>
      <p>The community that grew up around them was known as Beecher's Island
        and they church formed in 1844 was the Beecher's Island Presbyterian
        Church. The first postmaster changed the name to Nelson, but there is no
        record of why.</p>
      <p>For how our ancestors came to Nelson --- and what happened after they
        arriveed, see <a href="BeechersIsland.html">Beecher's Island</a>. </p>
      <p>At this point we don't know how many acres were purchased from the
        Beechers. When one of us gets the opportunity to go to the courthouse
        and examine the earliest tax records and maps we may be able to revise
        this page to be more specific and more accurate. </p>
