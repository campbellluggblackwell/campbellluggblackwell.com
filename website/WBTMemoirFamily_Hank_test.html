              <p>It's easy to think of Anne and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/Wiki/Thompson-47217">Hank</a>
                as being complete opposites. He was a mathematical prodigy, but
                math was her bugaboo. She had great people skills. Perhaps
                unfairly, I think of him as having "social dyslexia" and often
                seeing things backwards. Sometimes I thought that if he saw a
                "little old lady" struggling with an attempted purse snatcher,
                he would sympathize with the poor teenager, who was being
                savagely attacked with an umbrella.</p>
              <p>He was closest in age to me (13 years older vs Tom's 17 years)
                and we often shared the same bedroom, but I knew him the least
                well. Partly because he was away to college; then in the army in
                Washington state; then living in Norwich, NY; and then in the
                air force in Germany, Pakistan and Maryland.</p>
              <p>And partly because I felt his wife bullied me, so I often
                avoided them. Her excuse was that my mother had over-protected
                me (true) and that I needed to be "toughened up" to be able to
                stand army life when I got drafted. I never bought that story.
                I'd had rheumatic fever as a kid and still had a murmur. I
                instantly flunked my physical when the doctor walked down the
                line and gave us a once-over glance and was 4-F, unfit for
                service. I believe she just picked on me for the fun of it.</p>
              <p>When Anne and I talked about Hank, she would almost always say,
                "He was such a sweet child." My earliest clear memories of him
                were when he had polio and was in a body cast for spinal
                scoliosis. -- miserable in the summer heat before a/c, with
                sweat rolling down his neck and disappearing beneath the cast.
                And later, of him working (w/o the cast) on his extensive stamp
                collection -- stamps spread out on a card table or dining-room
                table, stamp tongs, Scott's catalogue at hand, a <a href="https://www.stampboards.com/viewtopic.php?t=68090">Stanley
                  Gibbons Color Guide</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation_gauge">perforation
                  gauge</a>, an open bowl of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tetrachloride">carbon
                  tetra-chloride</a> to detect watermarks filling the room with
                toxic, brain killing vapors and a towel for to place the
                carbon-tetrochloride soaked stamps on till they dried (which
                didn't take long).</p>
              <p>Before my time he went to a number of country schools in the
                Binghamton area. When they lived in The Town of Binghamton just
                south of the city in a neighborhood known officially as "Park
                Terrace Heights" (and informally as "Dog Hill") he formed a
                close friendship with two neighbors named 'Courtright,' and the
                three referred to themselves as "us twins."</p>
              <p>He had a remarkable brain. When a teacher presented a difficult
                math problem he'd often have the right answer immediately. But
                if the teacher asked what steps he'd gone through to get the
                answer, he often was out of luck and didn't get credit because
                he hadn't gone through any conscious steps -- the answer just
                popped into his head.</p>
              <p> Like a number of card players I've known, he could remember
                every trick, in every hand, in every game of bridge all night.
                Who had bid what. And who had played what. He would sometimes
                say "In the third hand of the fourth game tonight, when you got
                the lead you lead the __ of __. But you should have led ___."
                More remarkably he could play simultaneous games of chess --
                blindfolded. One of his hobbies was cryptography, which I
                suspect came in useful when he was in the Air Force, but
                assigned to NSA. I say "suspect" because he wasn't allowed to
                say much about what he did there.</p>
              <p>When he was going to Syracuse U., he would come home for
                holidays and breaks and bring homework. Some of his accounting
                courses had amazingly dull and pointless exercises. Just doing
                many, similar arithmetic problems for drill. Not teaching you
                anything -- just the same old problems done in grade schools for
                years, but with more digits in the numbers and more numbers in a
                column. Stuff that any accountant or bookkeeper would have done
                on an adding machine. Naturally they bored him to death. But
                they seemed like fun exercises to me because I wasn't used to
                working with so many digits on a page. So, I would do his
                accounting exercises for him while he was home.</p>
              <p>When he was gong to Syracuse U., one of the jobs he had was as
                a short-order cook, 3rd shift, at a greasy spoon lunch counter.
                They didn't get a lot of customers that late at night. Mostly
                regulars. The menu never changed, so he was annoyed by one of
                the regulars, would come in every night and say "What's new on
                the menu tonight?" One night, shortly before that customer was
                due, a bat got in the kitchen and they somehow killed it with
                brooms. Just before that customer came in and asked, "What's new
                on the menu tonight?" And was told "bat burgers." Thinking he
                was playing along with the joke, he answered "Fine, I'll have
                one of those." City health department and liability insurance
                not being then what they are now, Hank discretely dropped the
                bat in the deep fat fryer basket, and in a couple of minutes,
                put it in a large hamburger bun and served it. The customer took
                a bite, realized something was different than expected, opened
                the bun, put a napkin over his mouth and made a mad dash to the
                bathroom. Apparently neither the owner nor the health department
                were notified, so Hank didn't lose his job. But that customer
                never again asked "What's new."</p>
              <p>A couple of stories about Anne's practical jokes say more about
                her than him. She didn't play them often -- all the better to
                surprise. When she thought he's gone out for a night of poker
                and drinking, she liked to "<a href="https://www.instructables.com/Short-Sheet-Bed-Prank/">short
                  sheet</a>" his bed. But the crowning achievement (from a
                practical joker's point of view) -- and also the meanest, was
                the way she sabotaged one of his big dates. There was a girl
                he'd been wanting to ask out for some time, but was hesitant to
                try. Finally he found the courage to ask her out and was
                ecstatic that she accepted. You need to know that he had major
                sinus problems. This was before the days of pocket Kleenex. He
                would go through six or more handkerchiefs per night, so he
                would stuff he pants and jacket pockets with them, using the
                ones in his pants pockets first. She waited till he had done
                that. When he left the room for a minute, she removed one of the
                handkerchiefs from his sports jacket pocket (knowing he'd use
                the handkerchiefs in his pants pockets first) and replaced it
                with a pair of her frilliest, laciest, underpants. Sure enough
                that first date went well -- until, later in the evening, he
                reached into his jacket pocket for a handkerchief --- and pulled
                out a pair of lacy panties. No amount of explaining worked.
                "It's not what you think." "They're my sister's." "She's playing
                a joke on me." One relationship down in flames. </p>
              <p>All during WW2 he tried to enlist but was turned down by all
                the branches, including the Coast Guard. Nobody wanted someone
                with curvature of the spine, who had double hernia operations,
                who was color blind and couldn't see much with out his glasses
                and was post polio. Even at some of the peaks of the war, when
                they were desperate for manpower, he was turned down. Given that
                history, it's bizarre that he was drafted, when he had a job he
                liked, in what appears to have been one of the Broome Co. Draft
                Board's biggest screw ups. The Korean War was still active and
                the board had a significant quota to fill. But, rather than take
                younger, more fit candidates, they chose to fill all the slots,
                with guys who had been repeatedly passed over -- for sound
                reasons. They took a bunch of guys who had serious medical
                issues, but were about to turn 26 and become ineligible for the
                draft, and filled their quota entirely with them. Hank was the
                only one who made it through basic training. All the others were
                given medical discharges. I vaguely recall him being stationed
                in El Passo, because I remember that his chronic sinusitis
                cleared up in the higher altitude and low humidity. I have some
                of his letters from then packed away, in which he mentions a
                school he'd applied for. As I recall the army would send him
                there during his 2nd year of service -- but only if he would
                agree to extend his enlistment for one additional year. He took
                the deal and was sent to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanford_Site">Hanford
                  works</a> in eastern WA, as part of a radar controlled
                anti-aircraft battery, protecting our plutonium production
                facilities from Soviet bombers. Regardless of whether his being
                stationed there deterred the Soviets from attacking it may have
                been a factor in his later getting bladder cancer although
                thyroid cancer was probably a bigger risk.</p>
              <p>But while stationed there, he met a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_Army_Corps">WAC</a>,
                Sgt. <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Diehl-1359">Ellen
                  Diehl</a>, who had a sharp mind and an even sharper tongue.
                They arranged some joint leave time and he brought her home to
                "meet the family." Dad was a tough audience to audition for.
                About the only female he approved of "marrying into the family,"
                was my Cousin Dave's <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/McNitt-155">first
                  wife</a>. I can't imagine anyone not liking Evelyn.</p>
              <p>Anne once told me a strange story about that visit. A story
                that Hank told her. Why he would tell it to her seems hard to
                understand. She thought he told her because he regarded it as
                "cute." As I remember it, Hank told Anne that before the visit
                he said to Ellen, "I'm anxious for you to meet my sister. She's
                dear to me and I love her very much." To which Ellen supposedly
                replied "In that case, I hate her." To me that sounds more like
                jealousy than "cuteness." Assuming that account of the
                conversation is reasonably accurate, I find it hard to imagine
                anyone thinking it was a good idea to tell it to your sister.
                (Unless they had social dyslexia.)</p>
              <p>During that visit, Ellen quickly sensed the rivalry between my
                mother and grandmother and tried to build an alliance with gram
                as a counterweight to whatever influence mom and Anne might
                have. I think with some success. After having a daughter in WA,
                their army time was up and they moved to Norwich , NY where he
                managed an Army &amp; Navy store. I don't remember the details
                (if I ever knew them), but the owner got into some kind of a
                mess (bad check maybe) and the store closed.</p>
              <p>Hank could never have passed the Air Force's physical, which
                was more rigorous than draftees, but because he had been out of
                the army for less than a year, didn't need one. He enlisted in
                the Air Force and was sent to training in Ithaca, NY on
                servicing data processing equipment, and moved there with his
                family. He put in 17 years with the Air Force, which with his
                time in the Army enabled him to retire with 20 years credit.
                Most of that time was on assignment to NSA. Our parents were
                aging, so when he retired, he took a job with Xerox, servicing
                their copiers, living first in Susquehanna, PA and then in Great
                Bend, PA. After they died, he moved back to MD, reading and
                fishing. He had smoked for years, but found a way to quit that
                worked for him. </p>
              <p>COPD finally did him in. In one of our last conversations, he
                told me that he had regrets about not "living up to his
                potential." That he should have used his mathematical and mental
                gifts to have accomplished. But he made good use of them in one
                way. Thanks to his mathematical skills and business education,
                he invested his military and Xerox pensions wisely and left an
                estate that has benefited family and others.</p>
