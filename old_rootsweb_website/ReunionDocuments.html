      <p class="italic"><span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">Campbell
          Reunions</span> were held from 1893 through 1942 and resumed in 2000.
        They are now held in even numbered years. Initially they were primarily
        for the descendants of Joseph and Ann Clinch Campbell. But after the
        first year expanded to inlude their siblings, James and Mary Blackwell
        Campbell --- and other connected Luggs and Blackwells. Descendants of
        Joseph and James siblings, Sally CAMPBELL Hazlett and Jane CAMPBELL
        Hazlett participated and were officers. Friends and relatives also
        attended, sometimes more than 600 came for dinner, a program and a
        meeting.. In the modern series, attendance has been 50 or less.</p>

      <p class="italic"><span style="font-size:120%; font-weight:bold;">Campbell
          Cousins Dinners</span> were held from 19xx to 19xx. Until the last few
        years they were only for the 30 grandchildren of Joseph and Ann Clinch
        Campbell --- and whoever else the hostess chose to invite. But as those
        first cousins were dying out, they began inviting the next two
        generations.</p>
