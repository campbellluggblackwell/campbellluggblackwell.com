            <div class="w3-container">
              <p> I've previously mentioned that my siblings often seemed more
                like uncles and aunt. But my <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47216">sister</a>
                at times seemed almost like a second mother. And she was the one
                I felt safest sharing confidences with. (And with whom I may
                have set a record for the most times helping someone else move
                (and rearrange furniture). [I think she was only partially
                kidding when she said she was frustrated with an apartment she
                had on Binghamton's Park Terrace Pl. because she couldn't
                rearrange where the fireplace was located. :) ]</p>
              <p>I spent many hours with her gardening -- especially on a rock
                garden near a small lily pond dad built. And countless hours in
                walks through woods and fields, where she taught me how to
                identify wildflowers. (And occasionally steal some for
                transplanting.)</p>
              <p>I suspect that being a girl shielded her from much of the
                verbal abuse Tom was subjected to. But she may have been
                subjected more to the tugs and currents of the rivalry between
                mom and gram.</p>
              <p>She had strong people skills and many strengths: talent in art,
                embroidery, poetry, etc., but lacked self-confidence in some
                areas. Part of that was because of an injury she suffered as a
                teen where she broke her nose. It was rebuilt, but was not "A
                Thompson nose." Probably that was all for the better, but she
                was self-conscious about it. She was dyslexic, which may have
                been why she never graduated from high school. (She always felt
                self-conscious about that.) Instead she completed <a href="https://www.univstats.com/colleges/ridley-lowell-business-and-technical-institute-binghamton/">Ridley-Lowell
                  Business School</a>'s secretarial training where she learned
                typing, shorthand, filing, etc. Her dyslexia definitely was why
                she never got t drivers license. </p>
              <p>I believe there are many different types of intelligence,<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
                  href="#IntellegenceTypes" id="IntelligenceTypes-ref"></a> but
                hers were markedly different from the rest of the family, which
                sometimes led her to feelings of inadequacy. When she played
                chess with Hank she didn't stand a chance of winning (nor did
                I). He would look ahead several moves and planned carefully.
                Anne took pleasure in from time to time making a random more,
                just to throw off his plans.</p>
              <p>She had a strong sense of fashion, and as a teenager filled
                notebooks with fashion sketches. She worked in clay, water
                color, oils, charcoal and loved pastels. Being a "Sunday
                painter" ("a nonprofessional painter, usually unschooled and
                generally painting during spare time") was an important source
                of satisfaction to her. I'm not sure about the "unschooled"
                part. I know she took night school courses from two of
                Binghamton's best water-colorists. And she studied painting in
                oils from Binghamton's most prominent portrait painter. I
                believe there was more training, but I'm not sure of the
                details. She was also active in the arts and crafts scene,
                having her own candle making studio, roadside stand and
                participating in arts and crafts shows. Perhaps the Met wouldn't
                have bought any of her works, but I think many had considerable
                appeal and merit. If she ever tried to sell any of her art, I'm
                not aware of it.</p>
              <p>She wrote some poetry, had a small library of the works of
                Whitman, Longfellow and others, but her favorite poet was Emily
                Dickinson.</p>
              <p>She also collected antique demitasse cups and small tea sets.</p>
              <p>I never regarded her as a particularly good overall cook.
                (Successfully making jello remained elusive.) But she had some
                dishes that were very good. And she excelled at making a meal
                out of whatever ingredients were on hand and feeding her family
                on a limited budget.</p>
              <p>She worked at a variety of jobs. Secretarial jobs with
                insurance agencies. Being in charge of the candy counter at
                Sears -- that's where she met future husband George Gibson -- he
                worked for Sears as an appliance repairman. And she had a long
                and well appreciated job with Red Cross. All a boss had to do
                was say something like "Send a thank you letter." Or, "Send
                congratulations," etc. and she'd take it from there. She had a
                feel for marketing. One year her candy counter had a lot of
                candy canes left over after Christmas. They weren't selling at
                10¢ apiece, so she put up a sign saying "Special. 2 for 25¢" and
                quickly sold out! </p>
              <p>She was "unlucky in love." I liked some of her suitors who my
                parents disapproved of and think some would have made better
                husbands than she ended up with. Her first husband, George,<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"
                  href="#Monogram" id="Monogram-ref"></a> always treated me
                fine, I have no complaints there. But he didn't do as well by
                his wife and son. He was a navy cook in the south Pacific during
                the war. And he did very good impersonations of Jerry Lewis. But
                he had issues, especially with his employers and honesty. As I
                remember it, the only reason he wasn't prosecuted is that my
                parents and their lawyer visited the DA and got charges dropped.
              </p>
              <p>But indirectly, he played a role in my getting to hear my
                favorite poet, e.e cummings, do reading. He needed a bunch of
                tests done at the VA hospital in Syracuse. And needed another
                driver to come along, so I went with him. It was going to take
                several hours, so after dropping him off, I went to the nearby
                campus of Syracuse U. to look around and kill time. I had just
                started walking around, when a poster caught my eye. It
                announced that cummings would be giving readings at something or
                other hall in ten minutes. I asked directions, hurried off, and
                arrived at the lecture hall just in time. Seeing him in action
                as he brought his works to life -- and listening to his pauses
                and speed ups, changes in inflection and pitch was so very
                instructive about how he wanted them to sound. Someone just
                reading a page would have no idea how animated he wanted a
                'Whee' to sound -- or the different voices he used. I am
                grateful for that, but it doesn't atone for George's misdeeds. </p>
              <p>After several years of being a single mom, she married Herb. He
                was older, a retired IBM factory worker. He owned his home and
                had a good pension and benefits. And savings. I suspect she saw
                financial stability and a home for herself and her son. But it
                didn't work out as she had hoped. As time went on, Herb's
                drinking problem grew. One morning she called and said "He hit
                me last night. Come get me." I was happy to oblige and
                immediately left and retrieved her and as many belongings as we
                could fit in the car. (We went back later for the rest of her
                things.) She didn't divorce him, she wanted to stay on his
                health insurance, which was a very generous plan, but they
                remained separated until his death.</p>
              <p>Interpersonal relations were her strong point. She had many
                friends, several of them life-long. She was a good friend, a
                great listener, and could keep confidences. Even when illnesses
                limited what she could do, she still helped others. For example
                she volunteered for years for a suicide prevention hot line.
                Even when she was in a nursing home and struggling with vascular
                dementia, residents on her floor selected her as their
                representative. And she conducted drawing classes.</p>
              <p>She wanted to be cremated. But surprised me with her request
                for what to do with he ashes. She knew I lived near the
                Appalachian Trail (a half hour drive from it) and have spent a
                lot of time on it. So she said "I've always wanted to go on the
                Appalachian Trail, but never was able to. You know it well. Pick
                a place that has a nice vista or one that's pretty and spread my
                ashes there. By that time I wasn't so spry myself, but I picked
                a glen I'm sure she would have liked, with lots of mountain
                laurel and rhododendron, and scattered her ashes there, at a
                spot from which you can see the trail, maybe 100 feet away. </p>
              <p>But if she had had a tombstone a fitting epitaph would be "She
                made art and friends all her life."</p>

                subjective and lacking quantitative support. Similar
                accusations, perhaps with cause, were leveled at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung">Carl
                  Jung</a>. Funding may not be available, but I'm confident that
                if a large scale study was made, factor analysis would come up
                with similar categories -- even if not identical to Gardner's
                types. It's outside my field of competence, but my impression is
                that of the 3 founders of psychiatry, Freud, Jung and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Adler">Adler</a>,
                history has shown Adler's ideas to be closer to modern
