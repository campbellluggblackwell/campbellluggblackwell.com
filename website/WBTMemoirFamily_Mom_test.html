            <p>Writing about my mother always fills me with trepidation. I see
              her as complex, and don't feel I understood her as well as I did
              my father. <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hoyt-211">Jessica
                (Hoyt)</a> Thompson,<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#JessicaHoyt"

                id="JessicaHoyt-ref"></a> was born in the small town of Nelson,
              PA, (near Corning, NY) in 1892. She was the eldest of three
              daughters of Joseph DeForest Hoyt and Frances Viola Goodrich, but
              was "the apple of her father's eye." And according to her mother,
              very spoiled as a result.</p>
            <p>It was a small town, big enough to have a RR station, hotel,
              livery stable, two churches, a barber shop, post office and
              several small businesses, and served as a market place for the
              surrounding farms. Her great-grandparents were founders of the
              town, so she grew up in "one of the best families." Not wealthy,
              but active in he community and well respected. Her father was a
              farmer, who sometimes also operated a small store. Her maternal
              grandfather was the Methodist preacher and both her grandfathers
              were Civil War veterans and well respected. She was proud that she
              had multiple ancestors who were early settlers of the colonies,
              coming to MA, CT and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Amsterdam">New
                Amsterdam</a> in the early 1600s. And very proud of being a DAR
              member. (My dad's ancestors were early settlers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_France">New
                France</a>, coming with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_de_Champlain">Champlain</a>.)</p>
            <p>Perhaps because her family had been very involved in their
              community, we were brought up with a strong sense of community
              responsibility and civic engagement.</p>
            <p>Her rather idyllic childhood came to an abrupt end at the age of
              10, when the father she adored dropped dead at age 42. They lost
              the farm and she and her sisters and mother moved in with her
              maternal grandparents. But it was very cramped and four more
              mouths to feed was a strain on her retired grandparents income. As
              a result, she moved in with her father's sister, <a href="https:/www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hhoyt-3455">Inez
                (Hoyt)</a> Boller and her husband, (my namesake), <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Boller-100">Billy
                Boller</a>. Their two children had died very young, and they
              welcomed mom as if she was their child. Mom called Inez "Auntie."
              Inez was fond of all three of her nieces, but she and mom bonded.
              And Billy Boller was fond of her. My siblings and I had no living
              grandfathers and so we called him "Grampa Bill."</p>
            <p>She grew up on the Boller's farm, which in Inez' day was called
              "Rose Lawn Farm," but was weather beaten and in need of paint by
              the time I started visiting. We spent much of the summer there.
              Before my time, Tom had an ill-tempered pony there, named "Betty."
              (I assume that was her name when Grampa Bill bought her rather
              than being named after my mother's sister.) My siblings all had
              fond memories of "Auntie," but she died soon after I was born, so
              I had no memories of her. Mom loved the Bollers' sheep farm. Most
              of his income came from selling the lambs to a slaughter house
              each fall, but of course he also sold wool. And had a side job of
              a "milk route." He would get up before dawn each day, leave with
              his old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REO_Motor_Car_Company">Reo</a>
              stake bodied truck, and drive his assigned route, picking up the
              dairy farmers milk cans, taking them to a nearby condensary (a
              plant where raw milk was turned into condensed milk and canned).
              He would return the empty cans the next morning when he picked up
              that days milk.</p>
            <p>My visits there were invaluable for introducing me to what life
              was like in the 1800s. It had no electricity, no indoor plumbing,
              no central heating. On one side, in the yard next to the kitchen
              door and side porch, was a hand pumped well. The outhouse was on
              the opposite side of the house. Kerosene lamps provided the light
              at night. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potbelly_stove">pot
                bellied stove</a> provided the only heat. And kettles placed on
              top provided the hot water to pour in washtubs for Saturday night
              baths. Each bedroom had a wash stand, with a large bowl and
              pitcher for washing up in the morning. And a commode (cabinet to
              hold a chamber pot).<img src="Commode.png" alt="Photo of a combination washstand-commode (i.e. a cabinet to hold a chamber pot"

                style="width:20%; float:right;"> Crawling into a cold bed in an
              unheated bedroom in winter was nothing to look forward to so
              rectangular soap stones, with a handle, were heated on top of the
              stove and then used as bed and foot warmers. It made you
              appreciate modern conveniences. In summer, cooking was done on a
              two burner kerosene, table top stove. I especially remember the
              mattresses, which were stuffed with dried corn husks and made a
              lot of noise when you rolled over. Getting up on a cold winter
              morning, with the room temperature not much above freezing
              inspired getting dressed under the covers, as much as was
              practical. When I hear people waxing nostalgic about "the good old
              days," I think of what daily life was really like then. And of all
              the young children's graves in the cemetery. Lifespans then were
              not too different from now -- for those who lived to adulthood.</p>
            <p>One consequence of growing up on that farm was that she never
              wanted to have lamb or mutton again, and never cooked it for a
              meal. But she loved that farm and the memories it held for her.
              Wm. Boller left it to her when he died. She kept it for several
              years, but couldn't get out very often and reluctantly sold it.</p>
            <p>After graduating she went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansfield_University_of_Pennsylvania">Mansfield
                Normal School</a> and lived in a dorm. At that time, two years
              at a normal school <a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#NormalSchool"

                id="NormalSchool-ref"></a> was born in the small town of was
              required for a certificate to teach primary grades (1 - 6) and a
              third year to teach secondary grades (7 - 12). Mom got her primary
              certification, taught for a year in Nelson, returned to Mansfield
              for her secondary school certification, and in 1916 married the
              handsome ex-sailor who'd courted her with the mandolin. (NYS
              recognized PA certification, so she was able to teach there.)</p>
            <p>They first lived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Winfield,_New_York">West
                Winfield, NY</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Brookfield,_New_York">North
                Brookfield</a>, but soon settled in the Binghamton area, where
              she usually taught is small, rural schools. Dad and his
              brother-in-law, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Walker-36158">Roy
                Walker</a>, who lived nearby, enjoyed fishing in <a href="https://thecolgatemaroonnews.com/14662/news/the-loomis-gang-and-the-ghost-of-wash-loomis/">Nine
                Mile Swamp</a> (as did their sons later).</p>
            <p>Mom returned to Auntie's in Nelson for the birth of her first two
              children, "<a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47215">Tom</a>"
              (Walter, Jr. in 1917) and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47216">Anne</a>
              in 1919. (Her mother was living and working in Elmira, NY then. <a

                href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47217">Hank</a> was
              born in Binghamton in 1922. (I was an "afterthought" much later.)</p>
            <p>Her sister <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Hoyt-3419">Isabelle</a>
              graduated from Mansfield Normal School and taught Phys Ed in the
              Elmira area. I think Isabelle and her mother lived together before
              her marriage, but after Isabelle married in 1925, gram lived with
              her and husband Tom Field. Isabelle was childless and wanted to
              adopt me, but mom declined, which may have been fortunate for me
              because Isabelle died 2 years later from meningitis. And gram came
              to live with us.</p>
            <p>The Depression years were tough, with dad being unemployed or
              underemployed much of the time and Hank getting polio, but we
              survived (but moving often). WW2 brought relative prosperity, but
              mom gave up teaching when I was diagnosed with rheumatic fever.</p>
            <p>She was active in the community, teaching Sunday School, holding
              0 offices in the PTA and Presbyterian Women's Organization, the
              church choir (until she "lost her singing voice"), the somewhat
              prestigious Garden Club and and had been active in the Grange. She
              was active in several women's bridge clubs, painted and had great
              flower gardens. I always mistakenly thought she somehow managed to
              join the exclusive <a href="https://whichmuseum.com/museum/phelps-mansion-binghamton-11705">Monday
                Afternoon Club</a> -- that's what the sign still read. But
              apparently they had gone out of existence and she just belonged to
              a group that met there (perhaps the Garden Club). I do know that
              she attended regularly, whatever the group's name was.</p>
            <p>Her DAR membership meant a lot to her. I'm pleased that in 1939,
              when the DAR refused to let <a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/04/09/298760473/denied-a-stage-she-sang-for-a-nation">Marion
                Anderson use their concert hall</a>, she, like Eleanor
              Roosevelt, resigned in protest. </p>
            <p>In those days the country was awash in prejudice. The KKK openly
              held parades in most cities. Mayors and public officials often
              openly supported them. Racial stereotypes were ubiquitous: Rastus
              and Mandy jokes, black-face performers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jolson">Al
                Jolson</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minstrel_show">minstrel
                shows</a>.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#MinstrelShow"

                id="MinstrelShow-ref"></a> A common expression was "There's a
              Ni**er in the woodpile." Brazil nuts were called "Ni**er toes."
              Kids blithely counted "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eeny,_meeny,_miny,_moe">Eeny
                meeny, miny moe</a>, catch a ni**er by the toe."</p>
            <p>So, in some ways she was very progressive for her times and
              happily supported Nelson Rockefeller. But she also believed in
              preserving our country's WASP (White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant)
              cultural traditions. Immigrants were welcome, but needed to be
              "Americanized" and assimilated to understand, appreciate, and
              embrace American values. And we, as descendants of the early
              colonists, had a special obligation to help "enlighten" the
              foreigners. The emphasis seemed to be on the benefits to them (and
              the country) of their adopting our values. As was typical for her
              generation, there seemed little awareness that their culture and
              traditions could enrich American culture and life. One story in
              particular illustrates the "mixed messages" of my childhood. The
              first African-American family (whom I'll call "The Smiths") was
              moving into our neighborhood. Some of the neighbors were very
              upset and wanted to oppose it, but mom was very supportive.
              However, her support, as I recall, was worded "I'd a lot rather
              have good Ni**ers like the Smiths as neighbors than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polack">Polacks</a>
              like [those who] live next to me now." (BTW, the Smiths moved in
              and resided without incident, but were not invited to neighbors'
              picnics.)</p>
            <p>She had cardiac issues all her life and in later years, severe
              rheumatoid arthritis (sometimes painting with brushes strapped to
              her hands) and later a series of stokes and dementia.</p>
            <p>Their marriage wasn't conflict free, they often fought and even
              went through a trial separation in the early 1940s.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"

                href="#Won_theWar" id="Won_theWar-ref"></a></p>
            <p>She was a worrier. Overprotective of me. Insisted on picked out
              my clothes almost until I graduated from college. Loving but
              inhibited and not demonstrative. She'd read a popular book on
              parenting that said you shouldn't pick up a crying child or you'd
              spoil them and felt duty bound to stifle her "maternal instincts."
              I don't recall either parent ever saying "I love you" or once I
              reached school age, ever hugging me.</p>
            <p>And I see her as "meddling" in her children's lives. I've already
              mentioned her opposition to my marrying Rachel or Dottie. And I
              believe she campaigned against my brothers "getting involved with"
              Rachel's sisters. And to my sister's first marriage. But she'd
              also weighed in against her earlier suitors. And was adamant when
              my brother considered divorce to protect his kids from abuse. In
              part that was practical -- "No court is going to grant custody to
              the father." (Which was probably true then.) But also as a matter
              of reputation -- "Divorce isn't what we do." She and I had a
              showdown about her countermanding my orders to my kids. "It's a
              grandmother's prerogative to spoil her grandchildren if she wants
              to." (I won that one.)</p>
            <p>She had some great recipes (most of which were closely guarded
              secrets). Her usual cuisine was traditional New England. Meat
              wasn't done if it hadn't fallen off the bone yet. But she was a
              skilled baker. Huckleberry tea cakes were her <i>crème de la
                crème</i>. But she made great cream puffs, eclairs and popovers.
              (I make good popovers too, but from a recipe on the flour box.)
              And she made very good pies -- her chocolate pies especially are
              fondly remembered (but all her pies were good).</p>
            <p>She was extremely hospitable. Family friends who lived alone were
              always invited to our holiday meals. And anyone present as
              mealtime approached would be invited to stay to dinner even if
              that required a miracle of loaves and fishes to stretch what she
              had planned to serve in order to accommodate one more. She, and my
              sister both denied they took it seriously, but both liked to read
              guests <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasseography">tea
                leaves</a>. I recall many occasions in which my mother would
              begin doing a reading -- then suddenly become disturbed at what
              she saw, her facial expression would markedly change and she would
              quickly break off the reading, making some excuse such as the
              leaves had become rearranged. But they both believed they had
              "powers." My sister also read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmistry">palms</a>.
              One supernatural incident in particular comes to mind. They both
              were certain that at the moment Tom was injured they both woke up
              from frightening dreams and "knew" that something awful had
              happened.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#TimeWounded" id="TimeWounded-ref"></a>
              Of course it was weeks before they actually knew the details of
              when he was injured. A telegram did soon come from the War
              Department informing my parents that he had been injured and was
              in a hospital, but the specifics of what day and hour didn't come
              out until much later.</p>
            <p>Her sense of humor was very different from my father's and seemed
              that of the Victorian Age. She loved saying things like "<i>You
                scream; I scream; we all scream for ice cream.</i>" And "<i>Railroad
                crossing, look out for the cars. Can you spell it without any
                R's?</i>" Or "<i>Beach, birch and maple, all begins with 'A.'</i>"</p>
            <p>She especially liked to draw the following story, which you were
              invited to read aloud:</p>
            <blockquote> A B C D <img src="Fish.png" alt="Goldfish sillouette"

              C M ? </blockquote>
            <p> See footnote for the "correct" answer.<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"

                href="#Goldfish" id="Goldfish-ref"></a> If the "solution" seems
              pretty dumb, perhaps that proves that you're not a Victorian :)</p>
            <p> If you're up for one more sample of Victorian humor and their
              proclivity to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemism">euphemisms</a>,

            <p>One of the scars that I think the Victorian mindset inflicted on
              families was the tradition that family skeletons must be hidden
              away in well locked closets. Put out of sight and out of mind.
              Some of this may be tied in with a sense of shame and fear of
              damaging the family's reputation in the community. But these
              things are all part of life. And everyone's family has experienced
              one or more of them. A relative committed a crime or was raped.
              (My Uncle Maurice [pronounced 'Morris'] accidentally killed a
              neighbor.) Or had a child out of wedlock. Or had mental illness.
              Or was addicted to alcohol, drugs, gambling or whatever. My father
              wouldn't talk about his <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bulley-28">Uncle
                Kearney</a> [pronounced 'Carney'] -- didn't even want his name
              spoken in the house -- I don't know why, nor did any of Kearney's
              grandchildren have a clue what that was all about. All he's say
              was "Kearney's a bum. Don't be like Kearney."</p>
            <p> Not in connection to Kearney I've read in the papers about one
              adulterous cousin who was involved in a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/m%C3%A9nage_%C3%A0_trois">ménage
                à trois</a> that resulted in a trial and newspapers' field day.
              The rational given for secrecy is often to protect children, but
              as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemony_Snicket">Lemony
                Snicket</a> and <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/magination/4416428">Margaret
                Holmes</a> have shown, that may not always be the best way to
              protect children. </p>
            <p>Both of my parents enjoyed antiques. They would shop at dealers
              and flea markets, buy pieces they liked. Dad would refinish them
              if needed. If chair seats needed re-caning or their splint or reed
              seats replaced, they would usually pay to have that done. If the
              piece didn't have beautiful wood, dad would often paint it black
              and mom would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stencil">stencil</a>
              it, often in guild. Sometimes the refinishing would remove some <a

                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patina">patina</a> and
              decrease the piece' value as an antique, but the result was always
              a handsome piece of furniture. Mom collected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry_glass">cranberry
                glass</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_and_Sandwich_Glass_Company">Sandwich

              <p>(Name) She and my dad had a for-fun, running argument as to
                whether her name was originally "Jessica Phoebe Hoyt," or
                "Phoebe Jessica Hoyt." He would interchangeably address her
                sometimes as 'Jess' and sometimes as 'Phebe.' My impression is
                that the name she was given at birth was Phoebe Jessica, but
                that her father told her, "you can change it to anything you

                  "The State Normal Schools: Teaching Teachers and Others"</a>.
                He was right about the rigid discipline. She told me a story
                that confirms what Fritz says about the discipline. She said the
                curfew for females' dorms was 8 PM. One semester, in the last
                few days before graduation, 3 girls decided to celebrate by
                going to a drug store in Mansfield and have sodas. But they
                stayed to long and were caught sneaking back in through a
                window. They were immediately expelled and never graduated.<a href="#NormalSchool-ref"

                was strategic. Not wasting time making factual arguments, but
                knowing how to leverage the chinks in his emotional armor -- how
                to plant seeds that would grow and blossom into the results she
