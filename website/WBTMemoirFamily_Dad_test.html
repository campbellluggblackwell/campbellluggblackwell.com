              <p><a name="WalterFThompson1893"></a> I see my father as
                complicated, but perhaps all people are complicated if you know
                them well. He had an unfortunate childhood that left him
                scarred. He was verbally abusive to my siblings and me, and took
                his razor strap to my older brothers, but "mellowed" with each
                child and became a loving grandfather. He lived in a world of
                simple, but rather rigid, distinctions. People were either
                "good" or "bad." One transgression by a friend of decades was
                unforgivable -- they were crossed off his list. </p>
              <p>A neighbor from Ireland used to say "He hangs his fiddle
                outside the door." I think meaning that he was convivial with
                his coworkers and fishing buddies, but distant from his family.</p>

                  Frederick Thompson</a>, Sr.,was born in 1893, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plattsburgh,_New_York">Plattsburgh,
                  NY</a> to a tubercular, violinist, immigrant <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47214">father</a>,
                who died when dad was two and had no memories of; and a nurse <a

                  href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bulley-101">mother</a>,
                whom he didn't know well. When she was widowed with two young
                children, she left them in the capable hands of her <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/LaPlante-601">mother</a>,
                and moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamsport,_Pennsylvania">Williamsport,
                  PA</a> to work at the hospital she had graduated from, and to
                live with an older sister, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bulley-467">Mary
                  Jane (Bulley)</a> LaBelle.</p>
              <p>Dad and his older brother, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47213">Maurice</a>
                were raised on a farm, by grandparents they loved. His
                grandmother was born in this country, to a French speaking
                family (they were near the border with Quebec). His grandfather,
                born Michel Boulé in Canada but reportedly renamed Mitchel
                Bulley by the Sergeant that mustered him into the Union Army.
                The family spoke French at home and attended a church with a
                French speaking priest who gave the homily in French. "Gram," as
                he called her, had 11 children of her own, and raised 3
                grandchildren: dad, his brother, and their first cousin, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bulley-469">Harmon
                  Bulley</a>, who was 7 years younger. Those were reasonably
                happy years, altho his immigrant grandfather (who had had been
                wounded in three battles, survived two Confederate POW camps and
                had a wooden leg) was quite strict. But he felt loved. However,
                when dad was about twelve, his mother married a doctor, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Burnley-143">George
                  C. Burnley</a>, and dad &amp; Maurice joined their mother and
                step-father, who had just moved to a home in Nelson, PA.</p>
              <p> That was not a happy home. According to my father, their new
                step-father was an alcoholic who beat both boys and their mother
                when he was drunk. He and Maurice never forgave their mother for
                taking them from their grandparents. After four years she died.
                But before that, he and his brother had been practicing boxing
                so that one day they could defend themselves. I think when he
                was about 14 and Maurice was 15, their stepfather started to
                beat them, but they successfully fought back, beat him up, and
                ran away from home. But not before he met my mother.</p>
              <pa>The two brothers wandered around, together, for a while, doing
                odd jobs, including a stint as janitors in a bordello. (I heard
                that from my mother. He would never have mentioned such things
                to me or my siblings.) Eventually they made their way to
                Williamsport, to the home of his aunt and her husband, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/LaBelle-1695">Leonidas
                  Ovide LaBelle</a>, who was a machinist and apparently taught
                dad the basics of the trade. I didn't know any of this when I
                was growing up, just that dad and his LaBelle cousins were
                close. They often visited us, and we them, and we once took a
                vacation with one and his family. As I mentioned, dad and
                Maurice never forgave their mother, and refused to put a marker
                on her grave.</pa>
              <p>At the time, local school districts only had to provide
                education to 8th grade. That was the end of dad's formal
                education, but he was an avid reader and knew history quite
                well.</p>
              <p> When he was old enough, he joined the navy, and became a
                machinist on board a primitive submarine of the day. The US
                Navy's experimental designs of the K-series </p>
              <figure><img src="K1Sub.png" alt="Photo of US Navy K-series, pre WW1 subs"

                  style="width:25%;">Pre-WW1 US Navy K-series sub.</figure>
              <p>of subs were more dangerous to their crews than to enemy ships.
                The K-subs didn't see combat, but were used for patrolling
                coasts. </p>
              <p>We no longer have a photo of his boat (subs are 'boats,' not
                'ships'), but I think he served on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_K-5_%28SS-36%29">K-5</a>.
                They were used primarily for the Navy to figure out submarine
                tactics. I know he was stationed in Pensacola, FL. He used one
                leave to make a visit to Nelson, as a suitor. He apparently made
                a dashing figure in his uniform - enhanced by playing a
                mandolin. [He didn't "swear like a sailor." The only times I
                heard him swear was when hanging wall paper. Usually he relied
                on phrases such as "dagnabbit," "fiddlesticks," "hell's bells,"
                or "Jehoshaphat's ghost."] </p>
              <p>He was injured when an explosion (or fire) happened in the
                engine room and he took a discharge well before the US joined WW1.
                They married in 1916, after mom finished her 3rd year at
                Mansfield Normal School (which was all that was required for
                secondary school certification).</p>
              <p>He set some good examples for us: honesty, hard work, civic
                responsibility and the value of craftsmanship. I don't remember
                him ever saying it, but he clearly believed that children were
                to be seen, but not heard. His factory shift worked from 6 AM to
                3 PM, so he would go to bed early. And thump on the bedroom
                floor with a shoe if we were noisy. If that didn't quiet us long
                enough, he would wrap himself in a blanket (he didn't wear
                pajamas), come down the stairs far enough to be visible and
                GLARE. He had no need to say anything. And his glares were more
                eloquent than anything he could have said. He has a special one
                for every occasion.</p>
              <p>He had a stoic outlook and admired the Spartan boy's stoicism.</p>
              <blockquote> One of the most famous stories of Spartan discipline
                was about a boy who found a fox cub, which he planned to eat.
                When he saw his instructor approaching, the boy hid the fox
                inside his garment to avoid being caught. As the instructor
                questioned the boy, the fox began to claw and bite within the
                folds of the boy's tunic, yet the boy did not cry out. According
                to the legend, it was only when the boy fell dead to the ground
                with his stomach bitten through that the instructor realized
                what had happened. </blockquote>
              <p> (That's not my idea of behavior to emulate.) </p>
              <p> He raised us on maxims I can still hear, echoing around in my
                brain.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>"Better to be thought a fool than to speak up and remove all
                  doubt."</li>
                <li>"You get what you pay for."</li>
                <li>"Say what you mean &amp; mean what you say."</li>
                <li>"A place for everything and everything in its place."</li>
                <li>Bragging was a no-no -- "Don't toot your own horn." And
                  feeling sorry for yourself was a no-no too.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> If we said "That's not what I meant to say, the inevitable
                response was "Then why did you say it?" And long before my time
                he would ridicule Tom in front of the whole family by referring
                to Tom as "That damned fool." He never struck me (only
                threatened to). As I mentioned earlier, he took his razor strap
                to my brothers and his leather slipper to spank my sister. My
                mother used her hair brush to spank me.</p>
              <p> He was something of a misogynist. When my mother would have a
                group of women over, that was a "hen party." And the attendees
                were "biddies" or "battle axes." But he also had pejoratives to
                describe males: "blowhard," "stuffed shirt," or in the case of
                my father-in-law - "weak sister." (That was for crying at his
                daughters' weddings, something he felt no "|real man" would do.)
                And gender neutral put-downs such as "holy roller." As you can
                see, he could be very judgemental.</p>
              <p>He wanted us to grow up with excellent grammar and good
                manners, especially table manners. Some what incongruously, in
                order to teach us not to put our elbows on the table, offending
                elbows were subject to being jabbed with his fork. </p>
              <p> <img src="LaFayetteSedan.png" alt="Photo of Nash LaFayette sedan, ca. 1937"

                  style="width: 30%; float: right;">He was
                industrious. An excellent vegetable gardener, diligent pruner of
                grapevines, berry bushes, shrubs, etc. Replaced a long, laid
                field-stone front walk with one where the field-stones were set
                in concrete, carefully prepared gravel underneath. Built a
                large, stone fireplace in the back yard for grilling for picnics
                -- it even a range top. He did home repairs of all sorts and was
                especially proud of his painting skills; - mowing the meadow
                with a scythe; spending hours on his hands and knees, hunting
                errant dandelions with an old table knife to remove their roots
                (a custom I continued). And of course, tools were cleaned and
                put away. "Take care of your tools and they'll take care of
                you." During WW2, when Detroit wasn't making cars, dad did a
                great job of keeping our family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaFayette_Motors">Nash
                  LaFayette</a> running.</p>
              <p>He appreciated nature, but seemed to need a fishing pole or a
                gun in hand as an excuse to go for a walk. He would often take
                the family for a Sunday drive to see scenic views or when the
                fall colors were at their peak. Often my mother would pack a
                picnic lunch</p>
              <p>In politics, like all family members of Civil War veterans, he
                was a Republican. He had no use for Harry Truman, whom he
                considered "vulgar." He was comfortable with Republican
                "liberals," such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Rockefeller">Nelson
                  Rockefeller</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Javits">Jacob
                  Javits</a>. But he did finally bring himself to vote for a
                Democrat for mayor -- who happened to be the brother of a family
                friend. </p>
              <p>He had no patience with religiosity of politicians who "wrapped
                themselves in the flag." He derisively referred to them as "200%
                Americans." Speaking of religion, he believed in God and an
                afterlife (and Providence), and was a close friend of our
                minister, sang in the church choir (he had a good bass voice)
                and would say grace for occasions such as Thanksgiving, but he
                wasn't "churchy." I think he mostly went because that's just
                what one did. Theology or doctrinal points had no interest for
                him (nor for me).</p>
              <p>He loved music, and if possible, never missed a performance of
                "Saturday at the Met." He had no interest in dance, and not much
                in art.</p>
              <p>He wasn't good at managing money, it tended to burn a hole in
                his pocket and there was always a new fishing reel or rod that
                he coveted. </p>
              <p>Speaking of fishing, he enjoyed telling tall tales about
                fishing. He didn't consider it lying, because the listener
                should have know better that to give credence to preposterous
                stories. (Nor did he consider omissions as lying. Only what you
                actually said counted.) Some of his tall tales were quite long
                (as were the fish that got away). One of the shorter ones was
                abut the fishermen out on a lake. <i>"They caught so many fish
                  that the level of the lake went down so much that they ran
                  aground and had to walk all the way to shore, carrying as much
                  of the catch as they were able to."</i> (Inspired by such
                stories I once told one of my grandchildren, who liked to watch
                ducks and geese on a lake "It rained so much one day that the
                water level in the lake rose, leaving only the geese' heads
                still above water") Anyone who didn't recognize "whoppers" for
                what they were was "a damned fool." He did like "pulling
                people's leg" and had a dry, wry, sense of humor.</p>
              <p>His favorite jokes to tell had punch lines that listeners had
                to supply for themselves. E.g.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>"What's the difference between a
                  cross-eyed hunter and a constipated owl?"<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The cross-eyed hunter can't hit when he
                  shoots."</i><br>
                The listener was on his/her own to figure out the punch line.</p>
              <p>He was a perfectionist, who had high standards for everyone,
                himself included. Standards that were impossible for any child
                to meet. We became quite expert at interpreting his scowls and
                varied looks of disapproval. I hope his grandchildren
                encountered approval, but his children didn't. No matter how
                hard we tried, nothing we could do was ever "good enough."</p>
              <p>To his credit, he tried to teach me how to bowl, one of his
                favorite indoor activities. He showed uncharacteristic patients
                in showing me how to hold the ball, to walk with it, release it,
                etc. I vividly remember one occasion. I almost threw a strike.
                One pin wobbled a while, but stubbornly remained upright. After
                the pins had been reset, and I was preparing to throw my 1st
                ball, he carefully showed me how to position my hand and wrist
                -- just so. I observed carefully, tried hard to remember all the
                fine points, really concentrated in following his instructions
                -- and rolled a strike. I was elated and hoped for some sign of
                approval. But as I returned, all he said was "Now the next time,
                you need to hold your wrist more ..." Even throwing a strike
                wasn't good enough. :( </p>
              <p>But he could be supportive. Especially when it came to my
                efforts to free myself from my mother's over protectiveness. I
                had picked up a lot of wilderness skills in Boy Scouts and
                Explorer Scouts and was anxious to lead "expeditions" to the
                Adirondaks with myself and one or more classmates. He was always
                an ally on winning approval for such trips, and always was
                willing to chauffeur either the drop-off trip or the pick-up
                trip. Initially they were for one week, later for two. I was
                very emotionally immature, but my hiking, canoeing, camping, and
                navigating skills were advanced. The trips all went fine.</p>
              <p>He wasn't anti-social. He played board games and especially
                enjoyed playing cards -- hearts, pinochle (he was very good at
                that), canasta or other rummy games -- but not bridge. We would
                often play at home evenings. And on Friday or Saturday nights,
                they would get together with friends for two or three tables of
                whatever.</p>
              <p>He didn't like my mother trying new recipes. Often he would
                refuse to try the dish. He would pointedly leave the table
                (often taking his dishes with him, making a bowl of bread and
                milk and either eating it in the kitchen, standing up, or
                sometimes, bring the bowl back to the dining room table and eat
                it there.</p>
              <p>He was very supportive of my sister when her first husband
                would misbehave. She (and her son) were always welcomed back, to
                stay as long as needed. He made it very clear to his son-in-law
                that anything he did-unto-her would be done-unto-him -- with
                interest. No one considered those warnings as empty threats. He
                never begrudged those "refugee" visits. My parents had opposed
                the marriage. One night, prior to the marriage, my parents,
                sister and I (the whole household at the time except for my
                grandmother, who I think had gone to bed, discussed her choice.
                My sister was 30, and I was an almost grown-up (I thought) 14. I
                defended my sister as being old enough to make her own decision
                on such an important issue. My father said, "Shut up and sit
                down or I'll knock you down." So I did. I don't recall what else
                was said, but obviously she did marry George.</p>
              <p>Which brings me to dad's grand-parenting. I'm confident that I
                was a better father than he was, but he may have been a better
                grandfather than I was. He didn't like his son-in-law (for
                cause), but didn't take that out on his grandson. However, he
                intensely disliked one daughter-in-law (also for cause) and took
                it out on his granddaughter (mostly by ignoring her). My mother
                took him to task. "Walter, you're not being fair." (Calling him
                'Walter' was a sure sign of a lecture.) It's not your
                granddaughter's fault who her mother is. She's a victim, not a
                perpetrator. Stop being mean to her." And he did. He liked both
                grandchildren (and three more who came along later) and treated
                them with consideration and kindness. He did evolve.</p>
              <p>I mentioned in a previous chapter that he chewed tobacco,
                usually Five Brothers pipe tobacco. Sometimes he would light up
                a pipe of it, but usually he chewed it instead. Nicotine is a
                good herbicide, so in his war on dandelions, he often would
                target them when he spat. His aim was pretty good, especially
                when tossing popcorn or peanuts into the air above his head,
                tipping it back and catching the popcorn kernel or peanut in his
                mouth. (But not while chewing tobacco.)</p>
              <p>As he aged, he did not "go gentle into that dark night." He had
                a series of heart attacks, but did not want to follow the
                doctors' advice about changing his diet or being less active.
                "That's not living." (I couldn't understand at the time, but do
                now.) He didn't quite get his wish of "dying with his boots on."
                He had another serious heart attack but survived and was going
                to be discharged. I visited him at the hospital and planned to
                talk with a nurse about whether he would be discharged that day
                or the next. He was sitting in an easy-chair and we were
                chatting about his release, when suddenly he had convulsions and
                collapsed. I yelled "Nurse, nurse", but it was a massive
                coronary and he died before the staff could arrive -- even
                though they came running. He would not have wanted to survive as
                an incapacitated invalid -- he would have felt "a burden."</p>
