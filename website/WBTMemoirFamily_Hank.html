              <div class="w3=container">
                <p>It's easy to think of Anne and <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/Wiki/Thompson-47217">Hank</a>
                  as being complete opposites. He was a mathematical prodigy,
                  but math was her bugaboo. She had great people skills. Perhaps
                  unfairly, I think of him as having "social dyslexia" and often
                  seeing things backwards. Sometimes I thought that if he saw a
                  "little old lady" struggling with an attempted purse snatcher,
                  he would sympathize with the poor teenager, who was being
                  savagely attacked with an umbrella.</p>
                <p>He was closest in age to me (13 years older vs Tom's 17
                  years) and we often shared the same bedroom, but I knew him
                  the least well. Partly because he was away to college; then in
                  the army in Washington state; then living in Norwich, NY; and
                  then in the air force in Germany, Pakistan and Maryland.</p>
                <p>And partly because I felt his wife bullied me, so I often
                  avoided them. Her excuse was that my mother had over-protected
                  me (true) and that I needed to be "toughened up" to be able to
                  stand army life when I got drafted. I never bought that story.
                  I'd had rheumatic fever as a kid and still had a murmur. I
                  instantly flunked my physical when the doctor walked down the
                  line and gave us a once-over glance and was 4-F, unfit for
                  service. I believe she just picked on me for the fun of it.</p>
                <p>When Anne and I talked about Hank, she would almost always
                  say, "He was such a sweet child." My earliest clear memories
                  of him were when he had polio and was in a body cast for
                  spinal scoliosis. -- miserable in the summer heat before a/c,
                  with sweat rolling down his neck and disappearing beneath the
                  cast. And later, of him working (w/o the cast) on his
                  extensive stamp collection -- stamps spread out on a card
                  table or dining-room table, stamp tongs, Scott's catalogue at
                  hand, a <a href="https://www.stampboards.com/viewtopic.php?t=68090">Stanley
                    Gibbons Color Guide</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforation_gauge">perforation
                    gauge</a>, an open bowl of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tetrachloride">carbon
                    tetra-chloride</a> to detect watermarks filling the room
                  with toxic, brain killing vapors and a towel for to place the
                  carbon-tetrochloride soaked stamps on till they dried (which
                  didn't take long).</p>
                <p>Before my time he went to a number of country schools in the
                  Binghamton area. When they lived in The Town of Binghamton
                  just south of the city in a neighborhood known officially as
                  "Park Terrace Heights" (and informally as "Dog Hill") he
                  formed a close friendship with two neighbors named
                  'Courtright,' and the three referred to themselves as "us
                  twins."</p>
                <p>He had a remarkable brain. When a teacher presented a
                  difficult math problem he'd often have the right answer
                  immediately. But if the teacher asked what steps he'd gone
                  through to get the answer, he often was out of luck and didn't
                  get credit because he hadn't gone through any conscious steps
                  -- the answer just popped into his head.</p>
                <p> Like a number of card players I've known, he could remember
                  every trick, in every hand, in every game of bridge all night.
                  Who had bid what. And who had played what. He would sometimes
                  say "In the third hand of the fourth game tonight, when you
                  got the lead you lead the __ of __. But you should have led
                  ___." More remarkably he could play simultaneous games of
                  chess -- blindfolded. One of his hobbies was cryptography,
                  which I suspect came in useful when he was in the Air Force,
                  but assigned to NSA. I say "suspect" because he wasn't allowed
                  to say much about what he did there.</p>
                <p>When he was going to Syracuse U., he would come home for
                  holidays and breaks and bring homework. Some of his accounting
                  courses had amazingly dull and pointless exercises. Just doing
                  many, similar arithmetic problems for drill. Not teaching you
                  anything -- just the same old problems done in grade schools
                  for years, but with more digits in the numbers and more
                  numbers in a column. Stuff that any accountant or bookkeeper
                  would have done on an adding machine. Naturally they bored him
                  to death. But they seemed like fun exercises to me because I
                  wasn't used to working with so many digits on a page. So, I
                  would do his accounting exercises for him while he was home.</p>
                <p>When he was gong to Syracuse U., one of the jobs he had was
                  as a short-order cook, 3rd shift, at a greasy spoon lunch
                  counter. They didn't get a lot of customers that late at
                  night. Mostly regulars. The menu never changed, so he was
                  annoyed by one of the regulars, would come in every night and
                  say "What's new on the menu tonight?" One night, shortly
                  before that customer was due, a bat got in the kitchen and
                  they somehow killed it with brooms. Just before that customer
                  came in and asked, "What's new on the menu tonight?" And was
                  told "bat burgers." Thinking he was playing along with the
                  joke, he answered "Fine, I'll have one of those." City health
                  department and liability insurance not being then what they
                  are now, Hank discretely dropped the bat in the deep fat fryer
                  basket, and in a couple of minutes, put it in a large
                  hamburger bun and served it. The customer took a bite,
                  realized something was different than expected, opened the
                  bun, put a napkin over his mouth and made a mad dash to the
                  bathroom. Apparently neither the owner nor the health
                  department were notified, so Hank didn't lose his job. But
                  that customer never again asked "What's new."</p>
                <p>A couple of stories about Anne's practical jokes say more
                  about her than him. She didn't play them often -- all the
                  better to surprise. When she thought he's gone out for a night
                  of poker and drinking, she liked to "<a href="https://www.instructables.com/Short-Sheet-Bed-Prank/">short
                    sheet</a>" his bed. But the crowning achievement (from a
                  practical joker's point of view) -- and also the meanest, was
                  the way she sabotaged one of his big dates. There was a girl
                  he'd been wanting to ask out for some time, but was hesitant
                  to try. Finally he found the courage to ask her out and was
                  ecstatic that she accepted. You need to know that he had major
                  sinus problems. This was before the days of pocket Kleenex. He
                  would go through six or more handkerchiefs per night, so he
                  would stuff he pants and jacket pockets with them, using the
                  ones in his pants pockets first. She waited till he had done
                  that. When he left the room for a minute, she removed one of
                  the handkerchiefs from his sports jacket pocket (knowing he'd
                  use the handkerchiefs in his pants pockets first) and replaced
                  it with a pair of her frilliest, laciest, underpants. Sure
                  enough that first date went well -- until, later in the
                  evening, he reached into his jacket pocket for a handkerchief
                  --- and pulled out a pair of lacy panties. No amount of
                  explaining worked. "It's not what you think." "They're my
                  sister's." "She's playing a joke on me." One relationship down
                  in flames. </p>
                <p>All during WW2 he tried to enlist but was turned down by all
                  the branches, including the Coast Guard. Nobody wanted someone
                  with curvature of the spine, who had double hernia operations,
                  who was color blind and couldn't see much with out his glasses
                  and was post polio. Even at some of the peaks of the war, when
                  they were desperate for manpower, he was turned down. Given
                  that history, it's bizarre that he was drafted, when he had a
                  job he liked, in what appears to have been one of the Broome
                  Co. Draft Board's biggest screw ups. The Korean War was still
                  active and the board had a significant quota to fill. But,
                  rather than take younger, more fit candidates, they chose to
                  fill all the slots, with guys who had been repeatedly passed
                  over -- for sound reasons. They took a bunch of guys who had
                  serious medical issues, but were about to turn 26 and become
                  ineligible for the draft, and filled their quota entirely with
                  them. Hank was the only one who made it through basic
                  training. All the others were given medical discharges. I
                  vaguely recall him being stationed in El Passo, because I
                  remember that his chronic sinusitis cleared up in the higher
                  altitude and low humidity. I have some of his letters from
                  then packed away, in which he mentions a school he'd applied
                  for. As I recall the army would send him there during his 2nd
                  year of service -- but only if he would agree to extend his
                  enlistment for one additional year. He took the deal and was
                  sent to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanford_Site">Hanford
                    works</a> in eastern WA, as part of a radar controlled
                  anti-aircraft battery, protecting our plutonium production
                  facilities from Soviet bombers. Regardless of whether his
                  being stationed there deterred the Soviets from attacking it
                  may have been a factor in his later getting bladder cancer
                  although thyroid cancer was probably a bigger risk.</p>
                <p>But while stationed there, he met a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_Army_Corps">WAC</a>,
                  Sgt. <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Diehl-1359">Ellen
                    Diehl</a>, who had a sharp mind and an even sharper tongue.
                  They arranged some joint leave time and he brought her home to
                  "meet the family." Dad was a tough audience to audition for.
                  About the only female he approved of "marrying into the
                  family," was my Cousin Dave's <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/McNitt-155">first
                    wife</a>. I can't imagine anyone not liking Evelyn.</p>
                <p>Anne once told me a strange story about that visit. A story
                  that Hank told her. Why he would tell it to her seems hard to
                  understand. She thought he told her because he regarded it as
                  "cute." As I remember it, Hank told Anne that before the visit
                  he said to Ellen, "I'm anxious for you to meet my sister.
                  She's dear to me and I love her very much." To which Ellen
                  supposedly replied "In that case, I hate her." To me that
                  sounds more like jealousy than "cuteness." Assuming that
                  account of the conversation is reasonably accurate, I find it
                  hard to imagine anyone thinking it was a good idea to tell it
                  to your sister. (Unless they had social dyslexia.)</p>
                <p>During that visit, Ellen quickly sensed the rivalry between
                  my mother and grandmother and tried to build an alliance with
                  gram as a counterweight to whatever influence mom and Anne
                  might have. I think with some success. After having a daughter
                  in WA, their army time was up and they moved to Norwich , NY
                  where he managed an Army &amp; Navy store. I don't remember
                  the details (if I ever knew them), but the owner got into some
                  kind of a mess (bad check maybe) and the store closed.</p>
                <p>Hank could never have passed the Air Force's physical, which
                  was more rigorous than draftees, but because he had been out
                  of the army for less than a year, didn't need one. He enlisted
                  in the Air Force and was sent to training in Ithaca, NY on
                  servicing data processing equipment, and moved there with his
                  family. He put in 17 years with the Air Force, which with his
                  time in the Army enabled him to retire with 20 years credit.
                  Most of that time was on assignment to NSA. Our parents were
                  aging, so when he retired, he took a job with Xerox, servicing
                  their copiers, living first in Susquehanna, PA and then in
                  Great Bend, PA. After they died, he moved back to MD, reading
                  and fishing. He had smoked for years, but found a way to quit
                  that worked for him. </p>
                <p>COPD finally did him in. In one of our last conversations, he
                  told me that he had regrets about not "living up to his
                  potential." That he should have used his mathematical and
                  mental gifts to have accomplished. But he made good use of
                  them in one way. Thanks to his mathematical skills and
                  business education, he invested his military and Xerox
                  pensions wisely and left an estate that has benefited family
                  and others.</p>
                <p>(BTW, He was an excellent uncle to my younger son, Steve.)</p>
