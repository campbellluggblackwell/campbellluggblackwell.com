            <p><a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47215">My eldest
                brother</a> was my hero. He was kind and considerate to me. (I
              already mentioned his taking me for walks in his Adirondak
              pack-basket when I was a toddler.) I can't count all the things he
              introduced me to: puns, camping, poetry, Tolkien, folk music, how
              to identify sassafras and when to harvest it, and countless more.
              I couldn't wait till I was old enough to follow in his Adirondack
              paddling and hiking "footsteps." I was "Billy" to everyone else,
              but he always referred to me as "Willie" when I was a kid. He
              enlisted in the Army when I was a first grader, but always sent me
              things which I cherished -- rattlesnake rattles from the Mohave
              desert. A Navajo thunder-bird ring. Sea shells from the Pacific,
              etc. His letters home included "Tell Willie ..."</p>
            <p> He was superbly trained by the army. They sent him to the Mojave
              Desert to train for North Africa, but by the time he was finished
              they didn't need him in Africa anymore, so they sent him to Mt.
              Rainier, to train for fighting in Italy's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apennine_Mountains">Appenine
                Mts.</a> But by the time he graduated from that training they
              decided they needed him in the Pacific, and sent him to Hawaii for
              more training. Because he was taller than average, he was assigned
              to carrying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle">BAR</a>
              (a light machine gun usually fired prone supported by a bipod (a
              two legged support), but carried via a shoulder strap and capable
              of firing from the hip as you walked. He first saw action in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea">Papua
                New Guinea</a>, where he came to know and like a village of head
              hunters. "They're nice fellows as long as you stay on their good
              side." The Japanese committed atrocities and hadn't stayed on
              their good side, so the locals were glad to help guide the GIs.</p>
            <p>After that fighting was over, he was sent to northern Australia
              for R&amp;R, and then to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindanao">Mindanao</a>,
              for more combat. And finally to Luzon, where his mountaineering
              training was put to use as the allies moved toward <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baguio">Baguio</a>.
              His unit held a ridge in the mountains, protecting an Army
              Engineering crew building a road to Baguio for the advancing army.
              After weeks of being ahead of their supplies and having to live
              off of rice taken from the knapsacks of Japanese soldiers they'd
              killed, his company came under an intense artillery barrage and
              suffered 70% casualties in a half an hour. He had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_guilt">survivors'
                guilt</a> because he saw his best buddy disintegrate from an
              exploding shell. Tom was badly wounded, losing the use of one lung
              and carrying countless pieces of shrapnel (they would work their
              way out for decades). But he was sure that he would not have
              survived had his buddy, who was between Tom and the explosion, not
              absorbed the worst of the blast. While in a field hospital for
              months, he contracted malaria, which would flare up repeatedly
              over the next several years.</p>
            <p>To understand Tom, you need to know that he turned down repeated
              attempts to promotion to sergeant and remained a corporal. "I
              didn't want to order men to their death." Eventually he was moved
              to hospitals in San Francisco and DC, before recovering enough to
              be discharged. After getting his Purple Heart and other medals, he
              was offered disability, but declined. "I can still work."</p>
            <p>But like every combat veteran from WW2, Korea and Vietnam that
              I've known, he suffered from PTSD for the rest of his life. (In
              WW1 they called it "shell shock" and "battle fatigue" in WW2. But
              "real men" were supposed to be able to tough it out and not need
              help. Of course back then it wasn't well understood and the meager
              help available often wasn't much help.)</p>
            <p>Before he enlisted, he's met Anna Gretna Walker, sister of a
              close friend of his. Additionally, she was a friend and coworker
              of my sister. He and Gretna corresponded through is army years and
              married as soon as he was well enough. He went to Triple Cities
              College in Binghamton on the GI Bill (one of the best investments
              the US government has ever made) and got a BA in botany. Then,
              loving history, he attended the NYS College for Teachers in
              Albany, for an MS to teach HS history. But, discovering he didn't
              like his student teaching experience, upon graduation, took a job
              as an electronics technician at Link Aviation, where my father
              worked. He later transferred to their "Contracts" department where
              he negotiated with NASA and the DOD about contract specification
              details. (I didn't come on my versatility and ability to take on
              jobs with zero experience by pure chance.) I didn't get to see him
              much during his college years, he was pretty busy. But we always
              felt "connected."</p>
            <p>The second major trauma in his life was the death of twin sons
              when they were only a couple of days old. He wouldn't consider
              counseling and I think he was deeply scarred the rest of his life.
              He would visibly flinch when he encountered boys the age they
              would have been. And for a long time avoided my sons. Mom tried to
              encourage him and Gret to adopt, but he refused to consider it. He
              came back from the war still believing in God, but couldn't
              forgive him for allowing the carnage of WW2. He never again went
              in a church, except for weddings and funerals.</p>
            <p>For a while he had a cabin cruiser, based near Ithaca. But he
              spent many hours canoeing and many more in boats on lakes and
              rivers of all sizes, which is why he probably developed a melanoma
              on a leg that wasn't discovered until it had metastasized. That
              was in the days before the <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/affordable-care-act/">ACA</a>
              when insurance companies controlled most of the health care calls,
              and while he was getting radiation treatment for his cancer, his
              insurance company announced, "Sorry, you've reached your lifetime
              cap,<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#LifetimeCap" id="LifetimeCap-ref"></a>
              no more health insurance coverage for you. </p>
            <p>Speaking of funerals, there's a "small world" story about his
              funeral. After he was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer, a
              neighbor asked permission to tell the pastor of his nearby church.
              The pastor, whose church was just a few blocks away, on the same
              street, did visit. He was from the Philippines. At the time Tom
              was wounded, the pastor was a boy, hiding in the jungle, a few
              miles from Baguio, so they had a lot to talk about. The visits
              continued and they became friends. That pastor was invited to do a
              scripture reading at Tom's funeral. His presence was a big
              surprise to Tom's nephew's wife. He had been her youth pastor when
              growing up in Clarke Summit, PA. "It's a small world after all."</p>
            <p>Tom was multi-faceted. He was an excellent photographer,
              especially of blossoms. He had a sharpshooter medal from the army
              and participated in many target shooting meets, I think becoming a
              NYS champion. He was a talented wood carver. He hunted, fished,
              hiked, and canoed. He liked minerals, picking up specimens of
              semi-precious gemstones such as garnets and many "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herkimer_diamond">Herkimer
                diamonds</a>." He filled 3 walls of his basement with a model
              train layout with bridges and tunnels that accommodated several
              trains simultaneously. He spent countless hours building RR cars
              for the trains, buildings, trees, shrubs, etc. He was very active
              in the Masons,<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label" href="#Lodges" id="Lodges-ref"></a>
              both in his local lodge, but also statewide, popular because he
              had memorized so many of their rituals that had to be recited at
              various ceremonies. He would delve deeply into a hobby for several
              years, then put it aside and move on to new territory. He had a
              fine collection of antique glass and continued adding to that. </p>
            <p>Fishing remained a constant. He and Hank both went through
              periods of serious creators of trout flies and Hank made larger
              pieces, such as a "mouse" lure for bass. Dad and Hank continued to
              be avid trout fishermen, but all also did boat fishing for bass
              and Northern pike. Dad also liked to catch perch for eating. Both
              Dad and Tom would fly to remote areas in Quebec and northern
              Ontario in one of Link's planes and company pilots, a free benefit
              offered "old hands." </p>
            <p>I live just south of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocono_Mountains">Poconos</a>
              (they're more like hills than mountains, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmia_latifolia">mountain
                laurel</a> country). He loved photographing them (and dogwood
              blossoms), so each spring, when I saw that they were blooming, I
              would give him a "heads-up" phone call. For years after he died,
              when I would see their blossoms come out I would automatically
              think "I've got to alert Tom" -- and then feel sad when I
              remembered there was no need to call him. When he was a botany
              major, he impressed his professors with photographs he took
              through a microscope of single celled plants and had a talent for
              dyeing portions of a cell to provide better contrast. In later
              years he often used high magnification camera lenses to shoot tiny
              blossoms, barely visible to the naked eye, or close ups of
              lichens. For years he had his own darkroom where he developed and
              printed his photographs. I still have albums of his Adirondak
              hiking and canoe trips. And a small hard bound book he used when
              writing poems, short stories or verbal sketches. He liked
              capturing legends of Navajo and Pacific Islanders.</p>
            <p> When it became clear that he only had weeks left to live, I
              wrote him a letter, outlining how much he'd meant to me. I'm very
              glad I did that -- it meant a lot to him. When it became clear
              that he only had days left, I went up to Binghamton for a final
              visit -- staying at my sister's apartment. There already were
              blizzard warnings before I left her apartment to go to his home to
              say goodbye. I had the car radio on and when I was less than
              halfway there I heard the announcement that the sheriff had
              declared a state of emergency and closed the roads. I figured that
              it was now or never -- that if I turned around he'd be dead before
              the roads were reopened, and so I pressed on. Mine was the only
              car on the road. Main St. in Johnson City was NY17C -- two lanes
              each direction, with two lanes for parking. It was hard to see
              because it was snowing so hard. So I drove down the middle of the
              street (blinkers on), with the driver's window open so that I
              could scrape the windshield with one hand as I drove. Somehow I
              made it to his house and we said our goodbyes. I was glad I'd
              come, but the return trip to my sister's was some of the most
              challenging I'd ever done -- what with how hard it was snowing and
              how much had accumulated. But I'd grown up driving in NYS winter
              conditions, and made it back to my sister's OK and without being
              arrested. (I was always prepared for getting stuck in the snow. I
              had a sleeping bag in the car, so I wouldn't freeze. A shovel to
              dig out of a drift. Reflectors and flares to set out to reduce the
              chances of being hit. Etc.) He died the next day. It was 3 days
              before the state of emergency was lifted, so if I had turned
              around there would not have been another opportunity.</p>

                scout organization that did "good turns such as providing ushers
                and campus tour guides) have never interested me. Hank joined <a

                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry">the Masons</a>
                just to please Tom, but his heart was never in it. My uncle, Roy
                Walker, was active in Masons' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shriners">Shriners</a>.
                Billy Boller was in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improved_Order_of_Red_Men">Improved
                  Order of Red Men</a> and dad somehow ended up on the books of
                the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_of_Pythias">Knights
                  of Pythias</a> (but never participated in my time). My only
                interest in lodges was in beaver lodges -- those interested Tom
                too. He and Gret rented a lot on a lake and we liked to watch
                the industrious beavers come and go and add to their lodge.<a href="#Lodges-ref"
