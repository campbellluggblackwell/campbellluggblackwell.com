          <p> I've previously mentioned that my siblings often seemed more like
            uncles and aunt. But my <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Thompson-47216">sister</a>
            at times seemed almost like a second mother. And she was the one I
            felt safest sharing confidences with. (And with whom I may have set
            a record for the most times helping someone else move (and rearrange
            furniture). [I think she was only partially kidding when she said
            she was frustrated with an apartment she had on Binghamton's Park
            Terrace Pl. because she couldn't rearrange where the fireplace was
            located. :) ]</p>
          <p>I spent many hours with her gardening -- especially on a rock
            garden near a small lily pond dad built. And countless hours in
            walks through woods and fields, where she taught me how to identify
            wildflowers. (And occasionally steal some for transplanting.)</p>
          <p>I suspect that being a girl shielded her from much of the verbal
            abuse Tom was subjected to. But she may have been subjected more to
            the tugs and currents of the rivalry between mom and gram.</p>
          <p>She had strong people skills and many strengths: talent in art,
            embroidery, poetry, etc., but lacked self-confidence in some areas.
            Part of that was because of an injury she suffered as a teen where
            she broke her nose. It was rebuilt, but was not "A Thompson nose."
            Probably that was all for the better, but she was self-conscious
            about it. She was dyslexic, which may have been why she never
            graduated from high school. (She always felt self-conscious about
            that.) Instead she completed 
            <a href="https://www.univstats.com/colleges/ridley-lowell-business-and-technical-institute-binghamton/">Ridley-Lowell
              Business School</a>'s secretarial training where she learned
            typing, shorthand, filing, etc. Her dyslexia definitely was why she never got
            t drivers license. </p>
          <p>I believe there are many different types of intelligence,<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"

              href="#IntellegenceTypes" id="IntelligenceTypes-ref"></a> but hers
            were markedly different from the rest of the family, which sometimes
            led her to feelings of inadequacy. When she played chess with Hank she
            didn't stand a chance of winning (nor did I). He would look ahead
            several moves and planned carefully. Anne took pleasure in from time
            to time making a random more, just to throw off his plans.</p>
          <p>She had a strong sense of fashion, and as a teenager filled
            notebooks with fashion sketches. She worked in clay, water color,
            oils, charcoal and loved pastels. Being a "Sunday painter" ("a
            nonprofessional painter, usually unschooled and generally painting
            during spare time") was an important source of satisfaction to her.
            I'm not sure about the "unschooled" part. I know she took night
            school courses from two of Binghamton's best water-colorists. And
            she studied painting in oils from Binghamton's most prominent
            portrait painter. I believe there was more training, but I'm not
            sure of the details. She was also active in the arts and crafts
            scene, having her own candle making studio, roadside stand and
            participating in arts and crafts shows. Perhaps the Met wouldn't
            have bought any of her works, but I think many had considerable
            appeal and merit. If she ever tried to sell any of her art, I'm not
            aware of it.</p>
          <p>She wrote some poetry, had a small library of the works of Whitman,
            Longfellow and others, but her favorite poet was Emily Dickinson.</p>
          <p>She also collected antique demitasse cups and small tea sets.</p>
          <p>I never regarded her as a particularly good overall cook.
            (Successfully making jello remained elusive.) But she had some
            dishes that were very good. And she excelled at making a meal out of
            whatever ingredients were on hand and feeding her family on a
            limited budget.</p>
          <p>She worked at a variety of jobs. Secretarial jobs with insurance
            agencies. Being in charge of the candy counter at Sears -- that's
            where she met future husband George Gibson -- he worked for Sears as
            an appliance repairman. And she had a long and well appreciated job
            with Red Cross. All a boss had to do was say something like "Send a
            thank you letter." Or, "Send congratulations," etc. and she'd take
            it from there. She had a feel for marketing. One year her candy
            counter had a lot of candy canes left over after Christmas. They
            weren't selling at 10¢ apiece, so she put up a sign saying "Special.
            2 for 25¢" and quickly sold out! </p>
          <p>She was "unlucky in love." I liked some of her suitors who my
            parents disapproved of and think some would have made better
            husbands than she ended up with. Her first husband, George,<a aria-describedby="Endnote-label"

              href="#Monogram" id="Monogram-ref"></a> always treated me fine, I
            have no complaints there. But he didn't do as well by his wife and
            son. He was a navy cook in the south Pacific during the war. And he
            did very good impersonations of Jerry Lewis. But he had issues,
            especially with his employers and honesty. As I remember it, the
            only reason he wasn't prosecuted is that my parents and their lawyer
            visited the DA and got charges dropped. </p>
          <p>But indirectly, he played a role in my getting to hear my favorite
            poet, e.e cummings, do reading. He needed a bunch of tests done at
            the VA hospital in Syracuse. And needed another driver to come
            along, so I went with him. It was going to take several hours, so
            after dropping him off, I went to the nearby campus of Syracuse U.
            to look around and kill time. I had just started walking around,
            when a poster caught my eye. It announced that cummings would be
            giving readings at something or other hall in ten minutes. I asked
            directions, hurried off, and arrived at the lecture hall just in
            time. Seeing him in action as he brought his works to life -- and
            listening to his pauses and speed ups, changes in inflection and
            pitch was so very instructive about how he wanted them to sound.
            Someone just reading a page would have no idea how animated he
            wanted a 'Whee' to sound -- or the different voices he used. I am
            grateful for that, but it doesn't atone for George's misdeeds. </p>
          <p>After several years of being a single mom, she married Herb. He was
            older, a retired IBM factory worker. He owned his home and had a
            good pension and benefits. And savings. I suspect she saw financial
            stability and a home for herself and her son. But it didn't work out
            as she had hoped. As time went on, Herb's drinking problem grew. One
            morning she called and said "He hit me last night. Come get me." I
            was happy to oblige and immediately left and retrieved her and as
            many belongings as we could fit in the car. (We went back later for
            the rest of her things.) She didn't divorce him, she wanted to stay
            on his health insurance, which was a very generous plan, but they
            remained separated until his death.</p>
          <p>Interpersonal relations were her strong point. She had many
            friends, several of them life-long. She was a good friend, a great
            listener, and could keep confidences. Even when illnesses limited
            what she could do, she still helped others. For example she
            volunteered for years for a suicide prevention hot line. Even when
            she was in a nursing home and struggling with vascular dementia,
            residents on her floor selected her as their representative. And she
            conducted drawing classes.</p>
          <p>She wanted to be cremated. But surprised me with her request for
            what to do with he ashes. She knew I lived near the Appalachian
            Trail (a half hour drive from it) and have spent a lot of time on
            it. So she said "I've always wanted to go on the Appalachian Trail,
            but never was able to. You know it well. Pick a place that has a
            nice vista or one that's pretty and spread my ashes there. By that
            time I wasn't so spry myself, but I picked a glen I'm sure she would
            have liked, with lots of mountain laurel and rhododendron, and
            scattered her ashes there, at a spot from which you can see the
            trail, maybe 100 feet away. </p>
          <p>But if she had had a tombstone a fitting epitaph would be "She made
            art and friends all her life."</p>

                subjective and lacking quantitative support. Similar
                accusations, perhaps with cause, were leveled at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung">Carl
                  Jung</a>. Funding may not be available, but I'm confident that
                if a large scale study was made, factor analysis would come up
                with similar categories -- even if not identical to Gardner's
                types. It's outside my field of competence, but my impression is
                that of the 3 founders of psychiatry, Freud, Jung and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Adler">Adler</a>,
                history has shown Adler's ideas to be closer to modern
